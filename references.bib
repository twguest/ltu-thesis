	abstract = {In situ focus characterization is demonstrated by working at an extreme ultraviolet (XUV) free-electron laser source using ablation technique. Design of the instrument reported here allows reaching a few micrometres resolution along with keeping the ultrahigh vacuum conditions and ensures high-contrast visibility of ablative imprints on optically transparent samples, e.g., PMMA. This enables on-line monitoring of the beam profile changes and thus makes possible in situ alignment of the XUV focusing optics. A good agreement between focal characterizations retrieved from in situ inspection of ablative imprints contours and from well-established accurate ex situ analysis with Nomarski microscope has been observed for a typical micro-focus experiment.},

	abstract = {X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) have the potential to contribute to many fields of science and to enable many new avenues of research, in large part due to their orders of magnitude higher peak brilliance than existing and future synchrotrons. To best exploit this peak brilliance, these XFEL beams need to be focused to appropriate spot sizes. However, the survivability of X-ray optical components in these intense, femtosecond radiation conditions is not guaranteed. As mirror optics are routinely used at XFEL facilities, a physical understanding of the interaction between intense X-ray pulses and grazing incidence X-ray optics is desirable. We conducted single shot damage threshold fluence measurements on grazing incidence X-ray optics, with coatings of ruthenium and boron carbide, at the SPring-8 Angstrom compact free electron laser facility using 7 and 12 keV photon energies. The damage threshold dose limits were found to be orders of magnitude higher than would naively be expected. The incorporation of energy transport and dissipation via keV level energetic photoelectrons accounts for the observed damage threshold.},

More recently, a number of important phase visualisation and measurement techniques have emerged that do not require interference.

This is a relevant extension of current full-field phase contrast imaging, which requires full coherence. By the ability to reconstruct the coherent modes of the illumination (probe), as demonstrated here, the requirements of coherence filtering could be relaxed in many experimentally relevant settings. The proposed scheme is built on the mixed-state approach introduced in [Nature494, 68 (2013)], combined with multi-plane detection of extended wavefields [Opt. Commun.199, 65 (2001), Opt. Express22, 16571 (2014)]. Notably, the diversity necessary for the reconstruction is generated by acquiring measurements at different defocus positions of the detector. We show that we can recover the coherent mode structure and occupancy numbers of the partial coherent probe. Practically relevant quantities as the transversal coherence length can be computed from the reconstruction in a straightforward way.},

	abstract = {All images are flawed, no matter how good your lenses, mirrors etc. are. Especially in the hard X-ray regime it is challenging to manufacture high quality optics due to the weak interaction of multi-keV photons with matter. This is a tremendous challenge for obtaining high resolution quantitative X-ray microscopy images. In recent years lensless phase contrast imaging has become an alternative to classical absorption-based imaging methods. Without any optics, the image is formed only by the free space propagation of the wave field. The actual image has to be formed posteriori by numerical reconstruction methods. Advanced phasing methods enable the experimentalist to recover a complex valued specimen from a single or a set of intensity measurement. This would be the ideal case - reality teaches us that there are no ideal imaging conditions. Describing, understanding and circumventing these non ideal imaging conditions and their effects on X-ray near-field holographic (NFH) imaging are the leitmotifs for this thesis. In NFH the non ideal conditions manifest themselves in the illuminating wave field or probe. The probe generally does not satisfy the canonical assumptions of fully coherent and monochromatic radiation emitted by a point source. 
 
The main results of this thesis are compiled as a collection of publications. An approach is shown to reconstruct the probe of a X-ray nano-focus setup by a series of measurements of the probe at varied Fresnel number. The following chapter presents a study concerning the reconstruction efficiency in terms of resolution for near- and far-field based lensless imaging. In the following, the reconstruction scheme for the probe is extended to incorporate the effects of partial coherence in the near field. This enables the recovery of the modal structure of the probe which yields a full description of its coherence properties. 
Giving up the assumption of temporal stability due to the stochastic pulses, delivered by X-ray free electron lasers, the reconstruction of probe and specimen must be achieved from a single shot. A suitable scheme for this purpose is proposed in this work.},

	abstract = {We outline some basics of imaging using both fully-coherent and partially-coherent X-ray beams, with an emphasis on phase-contrast imaging. We open with some of the basic notions of X-ray imaging, including the vacuum wave equations and the physical meaning of the intensity and phase of complex scalar fields. The projection approximation is introduced, together with the concepts of attenuation contrast and phase contrast. We also outline the multi-slice approach to X-ray propagation through thick samples or optical elements, together with the Fresnel scaling theorem. Having introduced the fundamentals, we then consider several aspects of the forward problem, of modelling the formation of phase-contrast X-ray images. Several topics related to this forward problem are considered, including the transport-of-intensity equation, arbitrary linear imaging systems, shift-invariant linear imaging systems, the transfer-function formalism, blurring induced by finite source size, the space-frequency model for partially-coherent fields, and the Fokker-Planck equation for paraxial X-ray imaging. Having considered these means for modelling the formation of X-ray phase-contrast images, we then consider aspects of the associated inverse problem of phase retrieval. This concerns how one may decode phase-contrast images to gain information regarding the sample-induced attenuation and phase shift.},

But although soft X-rays areuseful for probing detail too fine for visible light microscopy in specimens too thick for electron microscopy, the highest-resolution applications of X-ray imaging have been traditionally limited to crystalline samples. Here we demonstrate imaging (at ∼75 nm resolution) of a non-crystalline sample, consisting of an array of gold dots, by measuring the soft X-ray diffraction pattern from which an image can be reconstructed. The crystallographic phase problem3 — the usually unavoidable loss of phase information in the diffraction intensity — is overcome by oversampling4 the diffraction pattern, and the image is obtained using an iterative algorithm5. Our X-ray microscopy technique requires no high-resolution X-ray optical elements or detectors. We believe that resolutions of 10–20 nm should be achievable; this would provide an imaging resolution about 100 times lower than that attainable with conventional X-ray crystallography, but our method is applicable to structures roughly 100 times larger. This latter feature may facilitate the imaging of small whole cells or large subcellular structures in cell biology.},

Not long ago an approach called in-line holography based on simple propagation became possible using partially coherent synchrotron beams like the ones available at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). Theoretical and experimental work by Cloetens et al. [Appl. Phys. Lett 75, 2912 (1999)] have shown that quantitative retrieval of the optical phase, from a set of radiographs taken at different sample-to-detector distances, is feasible. Mathematically speaking we are dealing with a direct method based on linearization in order to solve an inverse nonlinear problem. The phase retrieval can be combined with classical tomography in order to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the object’s electron density (holotomography). In order to optimize the image contrast for the numerical phase retrieval process, we have carried out calculations resulting in an optimized choice of value and number of the sample-to-detector distances as well as of the photon energy. These results were then confirmed by experiments on the ESRF long beamline ID19.},

	abstract = {We have performed x-ray phase-contrast tomography on mouse lung tissue. Using a divergent x-ray beam generated by nanoscale focusing, we used zoom tomography to produce three-dimensional reconstructions with selectable magnification, resolution, and field of view. Thus, macroscopic tissue samples extending over several mm can be studied in sub-cellular-level structural detail. The zoom capability and, in particular, the high dose efficiency are enabled by the near-perfect exit wavefront of an optimized x-ray waveguide channel. In combination with suitable phase-retrieval algorithms, challenging radiation-sensitive and low-contrast samples can be reconstructed with minimal artefacts. The dose efficiency of the method is demonstrated by the reconstruction of living macrophages both with and without phagocytized contrast agents. We also used zoom tomography to visualize barium-labelled macrophages in the context of morphological structures in asthmatic and healthy mouse lung tissue one day after intratracheal application. The three-dimensional reconstructions showed that the macrophages predominantly localized to the alveoli, but they were also found in bronchial walls, indicating that these cells might be able to migrate from the lumen of the bronchi through the epithelium.},

The resolution attainable is ultimately limited by the manufacturing tolerances for the optics.

Although CDI shows particular promise in applications involving X-ray free-electron lasers2, it is also emerging as an important new technique for imaging at third-generation synchrotrons. The limited coherent output of these sources, however, is a significant barrier to obtaining shorter exposure times. A fundamental assumption of coherent diffractive imaging is that the incident light is well-approximated by a single optical frequency. In this Letter, we demonstrate the first experimental realization of ‘polyCDI’, using a broadband source to achieve a factor of 60 reduction in the exposure time over quasi-monochromatic coherent diffractive imaging.},

Current is distinct from the local wavevector (not weighted) that could be observed by means of quantum weak measurement. For vector light, the current (Poynting vector) contains an additional term corresponding to the photon spin, recently identiﬁed for paraxial light by Bekshaev and Soskin but valid generally after a modiﬁcation to restore ‘electric–magnetic democracy’; this term has physical consequences. A number of examples demonstrate that there is usually no connection between optical vortices and angular momentum, and between C singularities and angular momentum. The optical wave current is distinct from the rays of geometrical optics in all nontrivial cases.},

However it has become evident that the experimental systems that have been developed are unable to fully utilize the coherent flux. This has led to a perception that coherence is lost while the radiation is transported down the beamline. However it is well established that the degree of coherence must be preserved, or increased, by an experimental system, and so this apparent “decoherence” must have its origin in the nature of the measurement process. In this paper we use phase space methods to present an argument that the loss of useful coherent flux can be attributed to unresolved speckle in the x-ray beam.},

An intense 25 fs, 4×1013 W cm−2 pulse, containing 1012 photons at 32 nm wavelength, produced a coherent diffraction pattern from a nanostructured non-periodic object, before destroying it at 60,000 K. A novel X-ray camera assured single-photon detection sensitivity by filtering out parasitic scattering and plasma radiation. The reconstructed image, obtained directly from the coherent pattern by phase retrieval through oversampling5,6,7,8,9, shows no measurable damage, and is reconstructed at the diffraction-limited resolution. A three-dimensional data set may be assembled from such images when copies of a reproducible sample are exposed to the beam one by one10.},

	abstract = {Modern protein crystal structures are based nearly exclusively on X-ray data collected at cryogenic temperatures (generally 100 K). The cooling process is thought to introduce little bias in the functional interpretation of structural results, because cryogenic temperatures minimally perturb the overall protein backbone fold. In contrast, here we show that flash cooling biases previously hidden structural ensembles in protein crystals. By analyzing available data for 30 different proteins using new computational tools for electron-density sampling, model refinement, and molecular packing analysis, we found that crystal cryocooling remodels the conformational distributions of more than 35\% of side chains and eliminates packing defects necessary for functional motions. In the signaling switch protein, H-Ras, an allosteric network consistent with fluctuations detected in solution by NMR was uncovered in the room-temperature, but not the cryogenic, electron-density maps. These results expose a bias in structural databases toward smaller, overpacked, and unrealistically unique models. Monitoring room-temperature conformational ensembles by X-ray crystallography can reveal motions crucial for catalysis, ligand binding, and allosteric regulation.},

Also preserved are updated earlier sections on practical methods, with detailed step-by-step accounts of the procedures needed to obtain the highest quality images of atoms and molecules using a modern TEM or STEM electron microscope. Applications sections have been updated - these include the semiconductor industry, superconductor research, solid state chemistry and nanoscience, and metallurgy, mineralogy, condensed matter physics, materials science and material on cryo-electron microscopy for structural biology. New or expanded sections have been added on electron holography, aberration correction, field-emission guns, imaging filters, super-resolution methods, Ptychography, Ronchigrams, tomography, image quantification and simulation, radiation damage, the measurement of electron-optical parameters, and detectors (CCD cameras, Image plates and direct-injection solid state detectors). The theory of Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and Z-contrast are treated comprehensively. Chapters are devoted to associated techniques, such as energy-loss spectroscopy, Alchemi, nanodiffraction, environmental TEM, twisty beams for magnetic imaging, and cathodoluminescence. Sources of software for image interpretation and electron-optical design are given.},

Their dynamics are then derived as the coupled Maxwell-Vlasov equations using a ﬂuid model. In solving these coupled equations, we introduce some important FEL parameters and concepts, such as the dispersion relation, the FEL parameter ρ, the power gain length L1GD, the saturation power Ps, and the undulator saturation length Ls. We also discuss two operating modes of FEL, the ampliﬁer and SASE (self-ampliﬁed spontaneous emission), as two typical cases of the initial value problem of the coupled Maxwell-Vlasov equations. We also discuss the radiation power, intensity ﬂuctuations, bandwidth, and coherent length for SASE. In the last section, without further derivation, we brieﬂy mention some results from the 3D FEL theory, e.g., the scaled power gain function G, the scaling parameter ρ and D, the energy spread, and the gain length calculation with scaling function.},

Specimen particles are flash-cooled after being dispersed on thin membranes supported by specially designed disks.

In addition, we use devices assisting the easy transfer of cooled specimens from liquid-nitrogen storages to the cryogenic pot. In the current experimental procedure, more than 20 000 diffraction patterns can be collected within 1 h. Here we report the key components and performance of the diffraction apparatus. Based on the efficiency of the diffraction data collection and the structure analyses of metal particles, biological cells, and cellular organelles, we discuss the future application of this diffraction apparatus for structure analyses of biological specimens.},

	abstract = {The wave propagation angle is one of the key factors in seismic processing methods. For the dual-domain propagators, it is sometimes necessary to acquire the wave propagation angle in the space-frequency domain instead of the wavenumber domain or the angle domain. We propose a method dealing with this problem, in which the wavefield gradient is used for the calculation of the wave propagation angle. The wavefield gradient can be directly obtained by either the finite difference approximation or the marching expression of the propagator. This method is not applicable in the case of extremely low frequency due to the comparability between the wavelength and the grid interval. Combined with the superwide-angle one-way propagator, this approach is instrumental in simulating the turning wave, which is hard to be handled by the traditional one-way propagator. Numerical examples show the good performance of the superwide-angle one-way propagator with our approach involved. The turning wave is modelled accurately; as a result, a high-quality image of the overhanging salt flank can be obtained.},

Specifically, we consider the case of a cylinder or a rounded edge, as a simple model for the edges of many biological samples. The Argand-plane signature of a propagation-based phase contrast fringe from the edge of a cylinder is studied, and the evolution of this signature with propagation. This, along with experimental images obtained using a synchrotron source, reveals how propagation within the scattering volume is not fully described in the projection approximation's ray-based approach. This means that phase contrast fringes are underestimated by the projection approximation at a short object-to-detector propagation distance, namely a distance comparable to the free-space propagation within the volume. This failure of the projection approximation may become non-negligible in the detailed study of small anatomical features deep within a large body. Nevertheless, the projection approximation matches the exact solution for a larger propagation distance typical of those used in biomedical phase contrast imaging.},

The kicker magnets typically produce rectangular field pulses with fast rise and/or fall times; however, the field strength is relatively low. To compensate for their relatively low field strength, the kicker magnets are generally combined with electromagnetic septa. The septa provide relatively strong field strength but are either DC or slow pulsed. This paper discusses injection and extraction systems with particular emphasis on the hardware required for the kicker system. Design options and computer aided design tools are also discussed. In addition, the interaction of the beam with the kicker system, primarily the kicker magnet, is considered.},

The key property in all these holographic approaches is coherence, which is required to extract the phase information through interference with a reference beam. Without this, holography is not possible. Here we introduce a holographic imaging approach that operates on first-order incoherent and unpolarized beams, so that no phase information can be extracted from a classical interference measurement. Instead, the holographic information is encoded in the second-order coherence of entangled states of light. Using spatial-polarization hyper-entangled photon pairs, we remotely reconstruct phase images of complex objects. Information is encoded into the polarization degree of the entangled state, allowing us to image through dynamic phase disorder and even in the presence of strong classical noise, with enhanced spatial resolution compared with classical coherent holographic systems. Beyond imaging, quantum holography quantifies hyper-entanglement distributed over 104 modes via a spatially resolved Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt inequality measurement, with applications in quantum state characterization.},

In an analogy to autocorrelation, we introduce field cross-correlation, which can be used to determine the complete complex field of unknown signal pulses if suitable probe pulses are available.

Storage-ring accelerators propel particles around a circular track and repetitively append the energy to the stored beam. The third type, also the most recent one in chronology, the recirculating accelerator, is designed to accelerate the particle beam in a short section of linac, circulate the beam, and then either continue to accelerate for energy boost or decelerate it for energy recovery. The beam properties of a linac machine are set at best by the initial particle sources. For storage rings, the beam equilibria are instead determined by the overall machine design. The modern recirculating machines share with linacs the advantages to both accelerate and preserve the beam with high beam quality, as well as e ciently reuse the accelerating components. The beamline design in such a machine conﬁguration can however be much more complicated than that of linacs.},

Beyond fundamental constraints on electron beam and undulator, we discuss optimized interaction geometries, include coherence properties along with the impact of diﬀraction, space-charge and spontaneous emission. Based on desired Quantum FEL properties, as well as current experimental capabilities, we provide a procedure for determining a corresponding set of experimental parameters. Even for an idealized situation, the combined constraints on space-charge and spontaneous emission put strong limits on sustaining the quantum regime over several gain lengths. Guided by these results we propose to shift the focus towards seeded Quantum FELs instead of continuing to aim for self-ampliﬁed spontaneous emission (SASE). Moreover, we point out the necessity of a rigorous quantum theory for spontaneous emission as well as for space-charge in order to identify possible loopholes in our line of argument.},

After describing the nature of non-linear effects and their impact on performance parameters of different particle accelerator categories, the theory of non-linear particle motion is outlined. The recent developments on the methods employed for the analysis of chaotic beam motion are detailed. In particular, the ability of the frequency map analysis method to detect chaotic motion and guide the correction of non-linear effects is demonstrated in particle tracking simulations but also experimental data.},

The power density of an XFEL pulse may be so high that it can modify the electronic properties of a sample on a femtosecond time scale. Exploration of the interaction of intense coherent x-ray pulses and matter is both of intrinsic scientific interest and of critical importance to the interpretation of experiments that probe the structures of materials using high-brightness femtosecond XFEL pulses. We report observations of the diffraction of extremely intense 32-fs nanofocused x-ray pulses by a powder sample of crystalline C60. We find that the diffraction pattern at the highest available incident power significantly differs from the one obtained using either third-generation synchrotron sources or XFEL sources operating at low output power and does not correspond to the diffraction pattern expected from any known phase of crystalline C60. We interpret these data as evidence of a long-range, coherent dynamic electronic distortion that is driven by the interaction of the periodic array of C60 molecular targets with intense x-ray pulses of femtosecond duration.

This work shows experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source raising its maximum power to more than 300\% of the current limit, while reducing the photon pulse length to 10 fs. This was achieved by minimizing residual transverse-longitudinal centroid beam offsets (beam yaw) and dispersion when operating over 6 kA peak current with a longitudinally shaped beam. Even shorter pulses of 3 fs were achieved by combination of this high current mode with an emittance spoiling foil.},

	abstract = {Self-seeding is an active filtering method for Free-Electron Lasers (FELs) enabling the production of nearly Fourier-limited pulses in the X-ray frequency range where external seeding is not available. Schematically, it is composed of three parts: a Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission (SASE) FEL working in the linear regime, a monochromator, and an FEL amplifier. Active filtering is achieved by letting the FEL pulse produced in the SASE FEL through the monochromator, while the electron beam is sent through a bypass, and its microbunching is destroyed due to dispersion. The filtered SASE pulse, serving as a seed, is recombined with the electron beam at the entrance of the FEL amplifier part. It is then amplified up to saturation and possibly beyond via post-saturation tapering. This allows for the production of high-brightness, nearly single-mode FEL pulses. The technique has been or will be implemented in a number of X-ray FEL (XFEL) facilities under operation or in the construction phase. In this chapter, we review the principle of self-seeding, its practical realizations, and related techniques.},

Focus optimization at XFEL beamlines presents unique challenges due to high peak powers as well as beam pointing instability, meaning that techniques capable of single-shot measurement and that probe the wavefront at an out-of-focus location are desirable. The techniques chosen for the comparison include single-phase-grating Talbot interferometry (shearing interferometry), dual-grating Talbot interferometry (moiré deflectometry) and speckle tracking. All three methods were implemented during a single beam time at the Linac Coherent Light Source, at the X-ray Pump Probe beamline, in order to make a direct comparison. Each method was used to characterize the wavefront resulting from a stack of beryllium compound refractive lenses followed by a corrective phase plate. In addition, difference wavefront measurements with and without the phase plate agreed with its design to within λ/20, which enabled a direct quantitative comparison between methods. Finally, a path toward automated alignment at XFEL beamlines using a wavefront sensor to close the loop is presented.},

The method implicitly rather than explicitly tracks speckles and utilizes the transport-of-intensity equation to give a closed-form solution to the inverse problem of determining the complex transmission function of the object. Implementation using x-ray synchrotron data shows the method to be robust and efficient with respect to noise.

	abstract = {Information regarding the flow in multi-phase systems, such as bubble columns, is necessary for the design of improved devices, as well as for the validation of computer models. Common optical methods are limited in bubble columns with a large void fraction. The reason that this should be is the difference in the refraction indices of liquid and gaseous phases, which leads to reflection and refraction of light. In addition, in flows without optical access, optical methods cannot be used. The method proposed by these authors in their previous paper regarding X-ray based particle tracking velocimetry (PTV)–called XPTV–resolves these problems. It allows us to measure the velocity three-dimensionally, non-invasive, and in devices without optical access. In bubble columns, X-rays are neither reflected nor refracted at the phase boundaries and the flow is penetrated in straight lines. Therefore, it works independently from the void fraction. This has been proved to be a reliable and useful measurement technique, circumventing the limitations of optical methods. This paper reports the latest improvements in the algorithms designed to track and reconstruct particles, a feature which is explained here in detail. The improved algorithms are applied to measure the hydrodynamic parameters in a bubble column under two different flow conditions.},

Their time structure, providing X-ray pulses of a few tens of femtoseconds in duration; and their extreme peak brilliance, delivering approximately 1012 X-ray photons per pulse and facilitating sub-micrometre focusing, distinguish XFEL sources from synchrotron radiation. In this opinion piece, I argue that these properties of XFEL radiation will facilitate new discoveries in life science. I reason that time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography and time-resolved wide angle X-ray scattering are promising areas of scientific investigation that will be advanced by XFEL capabilities, allowing new scientific questions to be addressed that are not accessible using established methods at storage ring facilities. These questions include visualizing ultrafast protein structural dynamics on the femtosecond to picosecond time-scale, as well as time-resolved diffraction studies of non-cyclic reactions. I argue that these emerging opportunities will stimulate a renaissance of interest in time-resolved structural biochemistry.},

	abstract = {X-ray crystallography provides the vast majority of macromolecular structures, but the success of the method relies on growing crystals of sufficient size. In conventional measurements, the necessary increase in X-ray dose to record data from crystals that are too small leads to extensive damage before a diffraction signal can be recorded-. It is particularly challenging to obtain large, well-diffracting crystals of membrane proteins, for which fewer than 300 unique structures have been determined despite their importance in all living cells. Here we present a method for structure determination where single-crystal X-ray diffraction ‘snapshots’ are collected from a fully hydrated stream of nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source. We prove this concept with nanocrystals of photosystem I, one of the largest membrane protein complexes. More than 3,000,000 diffraction patterns were collected in this study, and a three-dimensional data set was assembled from individual photosystem I nanocrystals ({\textasciitilde}200 nm to 2 μm in size). We mitigate the problem of radiation damage in crystallography by using pulses briefer than the timescale of most damage processes. This offers a new approach to structure determination of macromolecules that do not yield crystals of sufficient size for studies using conventional radiation sources or are particularly sensitive to radiation damage.},

Here we demonstrate that the performance of European XFEL sources can be signiﬁcantly improved without additional hardware. The procedure simply consists in the optimization of the undulator gap conﬁguration for each X-ray beamline. Here we provide a comprehensive description of the soft X-ray photon beam properties as a function of wavelength and bunch charge. Based on nominal parameters for the electron beam, we demonstrate that undulator tapering allows one to achieve up to a tenfold increase in peak power and photon spectral density in the conventional SASE regime. We illustrate this fact for the SASE3 beamline. The FEL code Genesis has been extensively used for these studies. Based on these ﬁndings we suggest that the requirements for the SASE3 instrument (SCS, SQS) and for the SASE3 beam transport system be updated.},

The investigation has been performed in a one-dimensional approximation assuming the electron pulse length to be much larger than a coherence length of the radiation. The following statistical properties of the SASE FEL radiation have been studied in detail: time and spectral field correlations, distribution of the fluctuations of the instantaneous radiation power, distribution of the energy in the electron bunch, distribution of the radiation energy after the monochromator installed at the FEL amplifier exit and radiation spectrum. The linear high gain limit is studied analytically. It is shown that the radiation from a SASE FEL operating in the linear regime possesses all the features corresponding to completely chaotic polarized radiation. A detailed study of statistical properties of the radiation from a SASE FEL operating in linear and nonlinear regime has been performed by means of time-dependent simulation codes. All numerical results presented in the paper have been calculated for the 70 nm SASE FEL at the TESLA Test Facility being under construction at DESY.},

Many methods that apply Shack-Hartmann wave-front sensor to wind profile measurement have been proposed. One of the obvious problems is the lack of a fundamental benchmark to compare the various methods. In this work, we present the fundamental performance limits for transverse wind estimator from Shack-Hartmann wave-front sensor measurements using Cram\&\#x00E9;r\&\#x2013;Rao lower bound (CRLB). The bound provides insight into the nature of the transverse wind estimation, thereby suggesting how to design and improve the estimator in the different application scenario. We analyze the theoretical bound and find that factors such as slope measurement noise, wind velocity and atmospheric coherence length r0 have important influence on the performance. Then, we introduced the non-iterative gradient-based transverse wind estimator. The source of the deterministic bias of the gradient-based transverse wind estimators is analyzed for the first time. Finally, we derived biased CRLB for the gradient-based transverse wind estimators from Shack-Hartmann wave-front sensor measurements and the bound can predict the performance of estimator more accurately.},

This approach satisfies both these needs by analyzing how a reference grid pattern is deformed by the presence of the sample, similar to a Shack-Hartmann sensor.

Some high efficiency solving methods for the TIE, extensively used in many works, are based on a Fourier-Transform (FT). However, to solve the TIE by these methods several assumptions have to be made. A common assumption is that there are no zero values for the intensity distribution allowed. The two most widespread Fourier-based approaches have further restrictions. One of these requires the uniformity of the intensity distribution and the other assumes the collinearity of the intensity and phase gradients. In this paper, we present an approach, which does not need any of these assumptions and consequently extends the application domain of the TIE.},

The topological properties of systems can be robust to defects and imperfections. Skyrmions are one such topological entity, which resemble “hedgehog-like” structures. Tsesses et al. controlled the interference of plasmon polaritons on a patterned metallic surface to generate a lattice of optical skyrmions. Such control could potentially optically mimic complex condensed matter systems or help in the development of robust optical communications and circuits.
Science, this issue p. 993
Topological defects play a key role in a variety of physical systems, ranging from high-energy to solid-state physics. A skyrmion is a type of topological defect that has shown promise for applications in the fields of magnetic storage and spintronics. We show that optical skyrmion lattices can be generated using evanescent electromagnetic fields and demonstrate this using surface plasmon polaritons, imaged by phase-resolved near-field optical microscopy. We show how the optical skyrmion lattice exhibits robustness to imperfections while the topological domain walls in the lattice can be continuously tuned, changing the spatial structure of the skyrmions from bubble type to Néel type. Extending the generation of skyrmions to photonic systems provides various possibilities for applications in optical information processing, transfer, and storage.
Controlled interference of surface plasmons can result in the generation of optical skyrmions.

	abstract = {In recent years, x-ray speckle tracking techniques have emerged as viable tools for wavefront metrology and sample imaging applications. These methods are based on the measurement of near-field images. Thanks to the simple experimental set-up, high angular sensitivity and compatibility with low coherence sources these methods have been actively developed for use with synchrotron and laboratory light sources. Not only do speckle-tracking techniques give the potential for high resolution imaging, but they also provide rapid and robust characterisation of aberrations of x-ray optical elements, focal spot profiles and the sample position and transmission properties. In order to realise these capabilities, we require software implementations that are equally rapid and robust. To address this need, a software suite has been developed for the "ptychographic x-ray speckle tracking technique" -- an x-ray speckle based method suitable for highly divergent wavefields. The software suite is written in Python 3, with an OpenCL back end for GPU and multi-CPU core processing. It is accessible as a Python module, through the command line or through a graphical user interface and is available as source code under version 3 or later of the GNU General Public License.},

	abstract = {The ever-increasing brightness of synchrotron radiation sources demands improved X-ray optics to utilize their capability for imaging and probing biological cells, nano-devices and functional matter on the nanometre scale with chemical sensitivity. Hard X-rays are ideal for high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic applications owing to their short wavelength, high penetrating power and chemical sensitivity. The penetrating power that makes X-rays useful for imaging also makes focusing them technologically challenging. Recent developments in layer deposition techniques have enabled the fabrication of a series of highly focusing X-ray lenses, known as wedged multi-layer Laue lenses. Improvements to the lens design and fabrication technique demand an accurate, robust,
              in situ
              and at-wavelength characterization method. To this end, a modified form of the speckle tracking wavefront metrology method has been developed. The ptychographic X-ray speckle tracking method is capable of operating with highly divergent wavefields. A useful by-product of this method is that it also provides high-resolution and aberration-free projection images of extended specimens. Three separate experiments using this method are reported, where the ray path angles have been resolved to within 4 nrad with an imaging resolution of 45 nm (full period). This method does not require a high degree of coherence, making it suitable for laboratory-based X-ray sources. Likewise, it is robust to errors in the registered sample positions, making it suitable for X-ray free-electron laser facilities, where beam-pointing fluctuations can be problematic for wavefront metrology.},

They are used for various experiments investigating physical and chemical properties in materials and biological science because of their complete coherence, high intensity, and very short pulse width. In XFEL experiments, specimens are irradiated by XFEL pulses focused by mirror optics. The focused pulse is too intense to measure its coherence by placing an X-ray detector on the focal spot. Previously, a method was proposed for evaluating the coherence of focused pulses from the visibility of the diffraction intensity of colloidal particles by the speckle visibility spectroscopy (SVS). However, the visibility cannot be determined exactly because the diffraction intensity is integrated into each finite size detector pixel. Here, we propose a method to evaluate the coherence of each XFEL pulse by using SVS in combination with a theory for exact sampling of the diffraction pattern and a technique of multiplying the diffraction data by a Gaussian masks, which reduces the influence of data missing in small-angle regions due to the presence of a direct beamstop. We also introduce a method for characterizing the shot-by-shot size of each XFEL pulse by analysing the X-ray irradiated area.},

	abstract = {We present a proof-of-concept three-dimensional reconstruction of the giant mimivirus particle from experimentally measured diffraction patterns from an x-ray free-electron laser. Three-dimensional imaging requires the assembly of many two-dimensional patterns into an internally consistent Fourier volume. Since each particle is randomly oriented when exposed to the x-ray pulse, relative orientations have to be retrieved from the diffraction data alone. We achieve this with a modified version of the expand, maximize and compress algorithm and validate our result using new methods.},

	abstract = {Simulations of experiments at modern light sources, such as optical laser laboratories, synchrotrons, and free electron lasers, become increasingly important for the successful preparation, execution, and analysis of these experiments investigating ever more complex physical systems, e.g. biomolecules, complex materials, and ultra–short lived states of matter at extreme conditions. We have implemented a platform for complete start–to–end simulations of various types of photon science experiments, tracking the radiation from the source through the beam transport optics to the sample or target under investigation, its interaction with and scattering from the sample, and registration in a photon detector. This tool allows researchers and facility operators to simulate their experiments and instruments under real life conditions, identify promising and unattainable regions of the parameter space and ultimately make better use of valuable beamtime. In this paper, we present an overview about status and future development of the simulation platform and discuss three applications: 1.) Single–particle imaging of biomolecules using x–ray free electron lasers and optimization of x–ray pulse properties, 2.) x–ray scattering diagnostics of hot dense plasmas in high power laser–matter interaction and identiﬁcation of plasma instabilities, and 3.) x–ray absorption spectroscopy in warm dense matter created by high energy laser–matter interaction and pulse shape optimization for low–isentrope dynamic compression.},

The detector is designed to comply with the requirements of the European XFEL. The radiation tolerant Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) is designed with the following highlights: high dynamic range, spanning from single photon sensitivity up to 104 12.5keV photons, achieved by the use of the dynamic gain switching technique using 3 possible gains of the charge sensitive preamplifier. In order to store the image data, the ASIC incorporates 352 analog memory cells per pixel, allowing also to store 3 voltage levels corresponding to the selected gain. It is operated in random-access mode at 4.5MHz frame rate. The data acquisition is done during the 99.4ms between the bunch trains. The AGIPD has a pixel area of 200× 200 μ m2 and a 500μ m thick silicon sensor is used. The architecture principles were proven in different experiments and the ASIC characterization was done with a series of development prototypes. The mechanical concept was developed in the close contact with the XFEL beamline scientists and is now being manufactured. A first single module system was successfully tested at APS.},

	abstract = {Recently, the European X-Ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) has successfully produced its ﬁrst X-ray photon pulse trains. This unique photon source will provide up to 27 000 photon pulses per second for experiments in different ﬁelds of science. In order to accomplish this, ultra-precise mirrors of dedicated shape are used to guide and focus these photons along beamlines of up to 930 m in length from the source in the undulator section to the desired focal point at an experimental station. We will report on a Kirkpatrick-Baez-mirror pair designed to focus hard-X-rays in the energy range from 3 to 16 keV to a 100 nm scale at the SPB/SFX instrument of the European XFEL. Both mirrors are elliptical cylinder-like shaped. The ﬁgure error of these 1 m long mirrors was speciﬁed to be better than 2 nm pv in terms of the height domain; this corresponds to a slope error of about 50 nrad rms (at least a best effort ﬁnishing is requested). This is essential to provide optimal experimental conditions including preservation of brilliance and wavefront. Such large and precise optics represents a challenge for the required deterministic surface polishing technology, elastic emission machining in this case, as well as for the metrology mandatory to enable a precise characterization of the topography on the mirror aperture. Besides the slope errors, the ellipse parameters are also of particular interest. The mirrors were under inspection by means of slope measuring deﬂectometry at the BESSY-NOM slope measuring proﬁler at the Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin. The NOM measurements have shown a slope error of 100 nrad rms on a aperture length of 950 mm corresponding to a residual ﬁgure deviation ≤20 nm pv for both mirrors. Additionally we found a strong impact of the mirror support conditions on the mirror shape ﬁnally measured. We will report on the measurement concept to characterize such mirrors as well as to discuss the achieved results.},

	abstract = {The European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (FEL) became the first operational high-repetition-rate hard X-ray FEL with first lasing in May 2017. Biological structure determination has already benefitted from the unique properties and capabilities of X-ray FELs, predominantly through the development and application of serial crystallography. The possibility of now performing such experiments at data rates more than an order of magnitude greater than previous X-ray FELs enables not only a higher rate of discovery but also new classes of experiments previously not feasible at lower data rates. One example is time-resolved experiments requiring a higher number of time steps for interpretation, or structure determination from samples with low hit rates in conventional X-ray FEL serial crystallography. Following first lasing at the European XFEL, initial commissioning and operation occurred at two scientific instruments, one of which is the Single Particles, Clusters and Biomolecules and Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SPB/SFX) instrument. This instrument provides a photon energy range, focal spot sizes and diagnostic tools necessary for structure determination of biological specimens. The instrumentation explicitly addresses serial crystallography and the developing single particle imaging method as well as other forward-scattering and diffraction techniques. This paper describes the major science cases of SPB/SFX and its initial instrumentation – in particular its optical systems, available sample delivery methods, 2D detectors, supporting optical laser systems and key diagnostic components. The present capabilities of the instrument will be reviewed and a brief outlook of its future capabilities is also described.},

	abstract = {A new interference technique to measure the transverse coherence of X-ray free-electron lasers is proposed and applied to the characterization of the coherence properties of ultra-intense focused X-ray pulses from the SPring-8 Ångstrom Compact free-electron LAser (SACLA)., Characterization of transverse coherence is one of the most critical themes for advanced X-ray sources and their applications in many fields of science. However, for hard X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) sources there is very little knowledge available on their transverse coherence characteristics, despite their extreme importance. This is because the unique characteristics of the sources, such as the ultra-intense nature of XFEL radiation and the shot-by-shot fluctuations in the intensity distribution, make it difficult to apply conventional techniques. Here, an extended Young’s interference experiment using a stream of bimodal gold particles is shown to achieve a direct measurement of the modulus of the complex degree of coherence of XFEL pulses. The use of interference patterns from two differently sized particles enables analysis of the transverse coherence on a single-shot basis without a priori knowledge of the instantaneous intensity ratio at the particles. For a focused X-ray spot as small as 1.8 µm (horizontal) × 1.3 µm (vertical) with an ultrahigh intensity that exceeds 1018 W cm−2 from the SPring-8 Ångstrom Compact free-electron LAser (SACLA), the coherence lengths were estimated to be 1.7 ± 0.2 µm (horizontal) and 1.3 ± 0.1 µm (vertical). The ratios between the coherence lengths and the focused beam sizes are almost the same in the horizontal and vertical directions, indicating that the transverse coherence properties of unfocused XFEL pulses are isotropic. The experiment presented here enables measurements free from radiation damage and will be readily applicable to the analysis of the transverse coherence of ultra-intense nanometre-sized focused XFEL beams.},

We find that with an appropriate normalization of these quantities, they are functions of only the ratio of the geometrical emittance of the electron beam to the radiation wavelength.

We demonstrate here the strong and coherent amplification of the 5(th) harmonic of a Ti: Sa laser (800 nm, 10 Hz, 100 fs) generated in a gas cell, i.e. 160 nm, by the SCSS (SPring-8 Compact SASE Source, Japan) Test Accelerator FEL. This is obtained by overlapping transversally, spectrally and temporally the external harmonic source in the in-vacuum undulator with the electron beam (150 MeV, 10 Hz, 1 ps). With only one undulator section, the 160 run seeded emission achieves three orders of magnitude higher intensity than the unseeded one, and presents a quasi perfect Gaussian shape in the spectral distribution. With two undulator sections, the seeded FEL spectrum reveals first effects of saturation. Those spectacular phenomena are associated to the generation of intense and coherent Non Linear Harmonics (NLH) at 54 nm and 32 nm. Finally, in view of the low seed level required, such amplification associated to NLH schemes would allow the generation of fully coherent soft X-ray radiations down to the water window.},

	abstract = {The resolution of X-ray diffraction microscopy is limited by the maximum dose that can be delivered prior to sample damage. In the proposed serial crystallography method, the damage problem is addressed by distributing the total dose over many identical hydrated macromolecules running continuously in a single-file train across a continuous X-ray beam, and resolution is then limited only by the available molecular and X-ray fluxes and molecular alignment. Orientation of the diffracting molecules is achieved by laser alignment. The incident X-ray fluence (energy/area) is evaluated that is required to obtain a given resolution from (i) an analytical model, giving the count rate at the maximum scattering angle for a model protein, (ii) explicit simulation of diffraction patterns for a GroEL–GroES protein complex, and (iii) the spatial frequency cut-off of the transfer function following iterative solution of the phase problem, and reconstruction of an electron density map in the projection approximation. These calculations include counting shot noise and multiple starts of the phasing algorithm. The results indicate counting time and the number of proteins needed within the beam at any instant for a given resolution and X-ray flux. An inverse fourth-power dependence of exposure time on resolution is confirmed, with important implications for all coherent X-ray imaging. It is found that multiple single-file protein beams will be needed for sub-nanometer resolution on current third-generation synchrotrons, but not on fourth-generation designs, where reconstruction of secondary protein structure at a resolution of 7 Å should be possible with relatively short exposures.},

It is able to be used to image extended objects at a resolution limited by scattering strength of the object and detector geometry, rather than at an optics-imposed limit. As technical advances allow larger ﬁelds to be imaged, computational challenges arise for reconstructing the correspondingly larger data volumes, yet at the same time there is also a need to deliver reconstructed images immediately so that one can evaluate the next steps to take in an experiment. Here we present a parallel method for real-time ptychographic phase retrieval. It uses a hybrid parallel strategy to divide the computation between multiple graphics processing units (GPUs) and then employs novel techniques to merge sub-datasets into a single complex phase and amplitude image. Results are shown on a simulated specimen and a real dataset from an X-ray experiment conducted at a synchrotron light source.},

	abstract = {Ptychography is a particularly powerful coherent diffraction imaging technique. In ptychography, a localized beam that illuminates the object is scanned in a step-wise fashion, resulting in an array of partially overlapping probing spots on the object. The intensity diffraction pattern from each spot is recorded separately. Then, a complex-valued image is computationally constructed from the set of measured diffraction patterns. Ptychography is based on scanning, hence it results with a long overall acquisition time, in the order of a second or more. Also, the scanning limited resolution, vibration stability, drift, and dynamic range weaken the performances of ptychographic microscopes. We propose and analyze single-shot ptychography, where tens or hundreds of quasi-localized, partially overlapping beams illuminate the object simultaneously. Various schemes for single-shot ptychography, in both the transmission and reflection modes, with coherent and partially coherent illumination and for single-shot Fourier ptychography are proposed. Experimentally, we demonstrate single-shot ptychography with a 180\&\#xA0;ms exposure time (limited by the CCD minimal acquisition time) using a sub-milliwatt diode laser that simultaneously illuminates the object with 49 partially overlapping beams. Single-shot ptychography, which combines the celebrated power of ptychography with (ultra)fast imaging, will surely open up new opportunities in microscopy.},

By capturing a stack of low-resolution images under different illumination angles, an inverse algorithm can be used to computationally reconstruct the high-resolution complex field. Here, we compare and classify multiple proposed inverse algorithms in terms of experimental robustness. We find that the main sources of error are noise, aberrations and mis-calibration (i.e. model mis-match). Using simulations and experiments, we demonstrate that the choice of cost function plays a critical role, with amplitude-based cost functions performing better than intensity-based ones. The reason for this is that Fourier ptychography datasets consist of images from both brightfield and darkfield illumination, representing a large range of measured intensities. Both noise (e.g. Poisson noise) and model mis-match errors are shown to scale with intensity. Hence, algorithms that use an appropriate cost function will be more tolerant to both noise and model mis-match. Given these insights, we propose a global Newton\&\#x02019;s method algorithm which is robust and accurate. Finally, we discuss the impact of procedures for algorithmic correction of aberrations and mis-calibration.},

The mean speckle size is computed through two approaches using both the two-dimensional and the one-dimensional normalized autocorrelation function in intensity. Additionally, we propose a distinct optimization of the determination of the mean speckle size by reduction of intensity values representing detected speckle patterns. Results of the determination of the mean speckle size are compared with theoretical predictions.},

Our analysis clariﬁes the conditions under which the method can give a good reconstruction and characterizes its performance.

This increase in velocity error is due to particle-position uncertainty, which is one of two sources of velocity errors studied here. The other source of error is particle acceleration, which has the opposite trend of diminishing at higher frame rates. Both kinds of errors can propagate into quantities calculated from velocity, such as the kinetic temperature of particles or correlation functions. As demonstrated in a dusty plasma experiment, the kinetic temperature of particles has no unique value when measured using PTV, but depends on the sampling time interval or frame rate. It is also shown that an artifact appears in an autocorrelation function computed from particle positions and velocities, and it becomes more severe when a small sampling-time interval is used. Schemes to reduce these errors are demonstrated.},

The window function is also known as the probe in the optics literature. As such blind ptychography is an inverse problem of simultaneous recovery of the object and the window function given the intensities of the windowed Fourier transform and has a multi-scale set-up in which the probe has an intermediate scale between the pixel scale and the macro-scale of the extended object. Uniqueness problem for blind ptychography is analyzed rigorously for the raster scan (of a constant step size τ ) and its variants, in which another scale comes into play: the overlap between adjacent blocks (the shifted windows). The block phases are shown to form an arithmetic progression and the complete characterization of the raster scan ambiguities is given, including: First, the periodic raster grid pathology of degrees of freedom proportional to τ 2 and, second, a non-periodic, arithmetically progressing phase shift from block to block. Finally irregularly perturbed raster scans are shown to remove all ambiguities other than the inherent ambiguities of the scaling factor and the aﬃne phase ambiguity under the minimum requirement of roughly 50\% overlap ratio.},

The speckle tracking procedure for a reference-less metrology mode is described with a detailed account on the advanced processing schemes used. A method to characterize and compensate for the imaging detector distortion, whose principle is also based on speckle, is included. The presented instrument is expected to find interest at synchrotrons and at the new X-ray free-electron laser sources under development worldwide where successful exploitation of beams relies on the availability of an accurate wavefront metrology.},

	abstract = {In the past few years, X-ray phase-contrast and dark-field imaging have evolved to be invaluable tools for non-destructive sample visualisation, delivering information inaccessible by conventional absorption imaging. X-ray phase-sensing techniques are furthermore increasingly used for at-wavelength metrology and optics characterisation. One of the latest additions to the group of differential phase-contrast methods is the X-ray speckle-based technique. It has drawn significant attention due to its simple and flexible experimental arrangement, cost-effectiveness and multimodal character, amongst others. Since its first demonstration at highly brilliant synchrotron sources, the method has seen rapid development, including the translation to polychromatic laboratory sources and extension to higher-energy X-rays. Recently, different advanced acquisition schemes have been proposed to tackle some of the main limitations of previous implementations. Current applications of the speckle-based method range from optics characterisation and wavefront measurement to biomedical imaging and materials science. This review provides an overview of the state of the art of the X-ray speckle-based technique. Its basic principles and different experimental implementations as well as the the latest advances and applications are illustrated. In the end, an outlook for anticipated future developments of this promising technique is given.},

	abstract = {An outstanding question in X-ray single particle imaging experiments has been the feasibility of imaging sub 10-nm-sized biomolecules under realistic experimental conditions where very few photons are expected to be measured in a single snapshot and instrument background may be signiﬁcant relative to particle scattering. While analyses of simulated data have shown that the determination of an average image should be feasible using Bayesian methods such as the EMC algorithm, this has yet to be demonstrated using experimental data containing realistic non-isotropic instrument background, sample variability and other experimental factors. In this work, we show that the orientation and phase retrieval steps work at photon counts diluted to the signal levels one expects from smaller molecules or with weaker pulses, using data from experimental measurements of 60-nm PR772 viruses. Even when the signal is reduced to a fraction as little as 1/256, the virus electron density determined using ab initio phasing is of almost the same quality as the high-signal data. However, we are still limited by the total number of patterns collected, which may soon be mitigated by the advent of high repetition-rate sources like the European XFEL and LCLS-II.},

	abstract = {The routine atomic resolution structure determination of single particles is expected to have profound implications for probing structure–function relationships in systems ranging from energy-storage materials to biological molecules. Extremely bright ultrashort-pulse X-ray sources – X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) – provide X-rays that can be used to probe ensembles of nearly identical nanoscale particles. When combined with coherent diffractive imaging, these objects can be imaged; however, as the resolution of the images approaches the atomic scale, the measured data are increasingly difficult to obtain and, during an X-ray pulse, the number of photons incident on the 2D detector is much smaller than the number of pixels. This latter concern, the signal `sparsity', materially impedes the application of the method. An experimental analog using a conventional X-ray source is demonstrated and yields signal levels comparable with those expected from single biomolecules illuminated by focused XFEL pulses. The analog experiment provides an invaluable cross check on the fidelity of the reconstructed data that is not available during XFEL experiments. Using these experimental data, it is established that a sparsity of order 1.3 × 10

	abstract = {The European X-ray Free Electron Laser is a highintensity X-ray light source currently being constructed in the Hamburg region that will provide spatially coherent X-rays in the energy range between 0.25 keV – 25 keV. The LPD, DSSC and AGIPD detectors are being developed to provide megapixel imaging capabilities with a dynamic range spanning from single photon sensitivity to 105 photons per pixel. Calibration of these detectors is challenging as a large set of calibration parameters (up to 109) exist. To provide a drop-in replacement for measured megapixel detector data, the X-ray Camera Simulation Toolkit (X-CSIT) has been developed. Based on X-CSIT, a X-ray detector simulation pipeline (XDSP) has been assembled to simulate a realistic detector response at a given experimental conﬁguration. Validation of XDSPs have been performed and an XDSP for the SPB/SFX imaging experiment based on calibration data of an AGIPD module has been implemented and integrated into the experiment’s start-to-end simulation framework simS2E.},

	abstract = {The European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (FEL) became the first operational high-repetition-rate hard X-ray FEL with first lasing in May 2017. Biological structure determination has already benefitted from the unique properties and capabilities of X-ray FELs, predominantly through the development and application of serial crystallography. The possibility of now performing such experiments at data rates more than an order of magnitude greater than previous X-ray FELs enables not only a higher rate of discovery but also new classes of experiments previously not feasible at lower data rates. One example is time-resolved experiments requiring a higher number of time steps for interpretation, or structure determination from samples with low hit rates in conventional X-ray FEL serial crystallography. Following first lasing at the European XFEL, initial commissioning and operation occurred at two scientific instruments, one of which is the Single Particles, Clusters and Biomolecules and Serial Femtosecond Crystallography (SPB/SFX) instrument. This instrument provides a photon energy range, focal spot sizes and diagnostic tools necessary for structure determination of biological specimens. The instrumentation explicitly addresses serial crystallography and the developing single particle imaging method as well as other forward-scattering and diffraction techniques. This paper describes the major science cases of SPB/SFX and its initial instrumentation – in particular its optical systems, available sample delivery methods, 2D detectors, supporting optical laser systems and key diagnostic components. The present capabilities of the instrument will be reviewed and a brief outlook of its future capabilities is also described.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) structures of biomolecules provide insight into their functions. Using X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) scattering experiments, it was possible to observe biomolecules that are difficult to crystallize, under conditions that are similar to their natural environment. However, resolving 3D structure from XFEL data is not without its challenges. For example, strong beam intensity is required to obtain sufficient diffraction signal and the beam incidence angles to the molecule need to be estimated for diffraction patterns with significant noise. Therefore, it is important to quantitatively assess how the experimental conditions such as the amount of data and their quality affect the expected resolution of the resulting 3D models. In this study, as an example, the restoration of 3D structure of ribosome from two-dimensional diffraction patterns created by simulation is shown. Tests are performed using the diffraction patterns simulated for different beam intensities and using different numbers of these patterns. Guidelines for selecting parameters for slice-matching 3D reconstruction procedures are established. Also, the minimum requirements for XFEL experimental conditions to obtain diffraction patterns for reconstructing molecular structures to a high-resolution of a few nanometers are discussed.},

We demonstrate the feasibility of recovering structural information at these extremes using low-ﬂuence images of a randomly oriented 2D x-ray mask. Successful reconstruction is obtained with images averaging only 2.5 photons per frame, where it seems doubtful there could be information about the state of rotation, let alone the image contrast. This is accomplished with an expectation maximization algorithm that processes the low-ﬂuence data in aggregate, and without any prior knowledge of the object or its orientation. The versatility of the method promises, more generally, to redeﬁne what measurement scenarios can provide useful signal.},

Hence, most of the technological developments as well as the scientific experiments performed by the user community were new and unique as outlined below. FLASH was driving FEL science and technology and paved the way for many new ideas. Because of using a linear accelerator in superconducting RF technology FLASH combines the extreme peak brightness characteristic for FELs with very high average brightness.

These include the imaging of protein nanocrystals, single particles such as viruses, pump–probe experiments for time-resolved nanocrystallography, and snapshot wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) from molecules in solution. The use of femtosecond exposure times, rather than freezing of samples, as a means of minimizing radiation damage is shown to open up new opportunities for the molecular imaging of biochemical reactions at room temperature in solution. This is possible using a ‘diffract-and-destroy’ mode in which the incident pulse terminates before radiation damage begins. Methods for delivering hundreds of hydrated bioparticles per second (in random orientations) to a pulsed x-ray beam are described. New data analysis approaches are outlined for the correlated ﬂuctuations in fast WAXS, for protein nanocrystals just a few molecules on a side, and for the continuous x-ray scattering from a single virus. Methods for determining the orientation of a molecule from its diffraction pattern are reviewed. Methods for the preparation of protein nanocrystals are also reviewed. New opportunities for solving the phase problem for XFEL data are outlined. A summary of the latest results is given, which now extend to atomic resolution for nanocrystals.

The varying illumination produced by wavefront ﬂuctuations between several pulses leads to a partially coherent average beam which can be decomposed into several coherent modes using ptychographic reconstruction algorithms. Such a decomposition can give insight into pulse-to-pulse variations of the wavefront. We discuss data collected at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and FERMI.},

The effect of mirror imperfections could be properly handled in the frame of the wave optics approach. In spite of the large distances, for hard X-rays one still needs to carry out full-scale calculations surpassing the far field approximation. It is shown that the slope errors corresponding to medium spatial frequency components are of a special importance for the properties of coherent beam reflection from ultra smooth mirrors. The typical height errors for this component should not exceed 1-2 nm. Calculations show that reflection on such a mirror surface still imposes substantial wave field distortions at distances of several hundred meters from the mirror relevant for European XFEL beamlines. Requirements and trade-off for high precision mirrors and demands to coherent beams propagations are discussed.},

	abstract = {High brightness electron sources for linac based short-wavelength free-electron lasers are developed and optimized for small transverse projected emittance at the photo-injector test facility at DESY, location Zeuthen (PITZ). A major part of the measurement program at PITZ is dedicated to transverse phase space optimization in order to fulﬁll the requirements of the European X-ray free-electron laser (European XFEL). A laser-driven RF-gun, treated with a dry-ice sublimation-impulse cleaning technique, a new photocathode laser system allowing short rise and fall times of the ﬂat-top temporal distribution as well as several new diagnostic components have been installed at PITZ in 2008. The electrons generated via the photo-effect at a cesium telluride (Cs2Te) cathode are accelerated by a 1.6 cell L-band RF-gun cavity with a maximum accelerating gradient at the cathode of about 60 MV/m. The transverse projected emittance is measured using a single slit scan technique. In the 2008–2009 run period, a detailed characterization of the projected transverse emittance was performed at different operating conditions. Optimizations and measurement results as well as simulation predictions of the transverse projected emittance for bunch charges of 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1 nC are presented and discussed in this paper. The geometric mean of the normalized projected rms emittance in both transverse directions for an electron bunch charge of 1 nC was measured to be 0.8970.01 mm mrad for a 100\% rms phase-space distribution.},

Using physical optics propagation simulations and the formalism of Church and Takacs [Opt. Eng. 34, 353 (1995)], we show that diffraction limited optics commonly found at XFEL facilities posses a critical spatial wavelength that makes them less sensitive to slope errors, and more sensitive to height error. Given the number of XFELs currently operating or under construction across the world, we hope that this simple observation will help to correctly deﬁne speciﬁcations for x-ray optics to be deployed at XFELs, possibly reducing the budget and the timeframe needed to complete the optical manufacturing and metrology.},

	abstract = {The SwissFEL soft X-ray free-electron laser (FEL) beamline Athos will be ready for user operation in 2021. Its design includes a novel layout of alternating magnetic chicanes and short undulator segments. Together with the APPLE X architecture of undulators, the Athos branch can be operated in different modes producing FEL beams with unique characteristics ranging from attosecond pulse length to high-power modes. Further space has been reserved for upgrades including modulators and an external seeding laser for better timing control. All of these schemes rely on state-of-the-art technologies described in this overview. The optical transport line distributing the FEL beam to the experimental stations was designed with the whole range of beam parameters in mind. Currently two experimental stations, one for condensed matter and quantum materials research and a second one for atomic, molecular and optical physics, chemical sciences and ultrafast single-particle imaging, are being laid out such that they can profit from the unique soft X-ray pulses produced in the Athos branch in an optimal way.},

	abstract = {The advent of ultrafast X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) opens the tantalizing possibility of the atomic-resolution imaging of reproducible objects such as viruses, nanoparticles, single molecules, clusters, and perhaps biological cells, achieving a resolution for single particle imaging better than a few tens of nanometers. Improving upon this is a signiﬁcant challenge which has been the focus of a global single particle imaging (SPI) initiative launched in December 2014 at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, USA. A roadmap was outlined, and signiﬁcant multi-disciplinary effort has since been devoted to work on the technical challenges of SPI such as radiation damage, beam characterization, beamline instrumentation and optics, sample preparation and delivery and algorithm development at multiple institutions involved in the SPI initiative. Currently, the SPI initiative has achieved 3D imaging of rice dwarf virus (RDV) and coliphage PR772 viruses at {\textasciitilde}10 nm resolution by using soft X-ray FEL pulses at the Atomic Molecular and Optical (AMO) instrument of LCLS. Meanwhile, diffraction patterns with signal above noise up to the corner of the detector with a resolution of {\textasciitilde}6 Ångström (Å) were also recorded with hard X-rays at the Coherent X-ray Imaging (CXI) instrument, also at LCLS. Achieving atomic resolution is truly a grand challenge and there is still a long way to go in light of recent developments in electron microscopy. However, the potential for studying dynamics at physiological conditions and capturing ultrafast biological, chemical and physical processes represents a tremendous potential application, attracting continued interest in pursuing further method development. In this paper, we give a brief introduction of SPI developments and look ahead to further method development.},

	abstract = {The emergence of high repetition-rate X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) powered by superconducting accelerator technology enables the measurement of significantly more experimental data per day than was previously possible. The European XFEL is expected to provide 27,000 pulses per second, over two orders of magnitude more than any other XFEL. The increased pulse rate is a key enabling factor for single-particle X-ray diffractive imaging, which relies on averaging the weak diffraction signal from single biological particles. Taking full advantage of this new capability requires that all experimental steps, from sample preparation and delivery to the acquisition of diffraction patterns, are compatible with the increased pulse repetition rate. Here, we show that single-particle imaging can be performed using X-ray pulses at megahertz repetition rates. The results obtained pave the way towards exploiting high repetition-rate X-ray free-electron lasers for single-particle imaging at their full repetition rate.},

	abstract = {Freie Elektronen Laser (FELs) haben dank ihrer ultrakurzen, hochintensiven und koharenten Strahlung hervorragende Moglichkeiten im Bereich der Wissenschaft mit Rontgenstrahlung geschaffen. Zur Zeit basieren die meisten FELs auf dem Mechanismus der Selbstverstaerkung spontaner Emission (englische Abk. SASE), einem stochastischen Prozess, was sich in der Emission von Pulsen mit stark fluktuierenden Eigenschaften manifestiert. Eine Vielzahl neuartiger Experimente an FELs bedarf stark fokussierter Strahlung. Ins- besondere fur die Abbildung einzelner, nichtkristalliner, biologischer Teilchen, wird da- her eine genaue Charakterisierung spezifischer Eigenschaften des komplexen Wellenfeldes des FELs in Abhangigkeit der Maschinenparameter fu r jeden einzelnen Schuss benotigt. Ein deterministischer Zugang, der auf verschiedene FEL Strahlungsregime angewendet werden kann ist zur Untersuchung der Rontgenstrahleigenschaften wunschenswert. Eine statistische Auswertung der ermittelten Eigenschaften fur eine Anzahl verschiedener Pulsensembles fuhrt somit zu einem Verstandnis der Strahlungscharakteristiken und kann potenziel zur Optimierung dieser verwendet werden. Die systematische Veranderung der Strahlungsregime und quantitative Messung von Pulsen, die sich von Schuss zu Schuss innerhalb des Ensembles unterscheiden, erlaubt die Beobachtung der Variabilitat gemessener Parameter zwischen verschiedenen Ensemblen. 
 
In dieser Arbeit werden verschiedene Realisierungen und Methoden der Messung fokussierter Lichtfelder an der Beamline BL2 am Freie Elektronenlaser Hamburg (FLASH) in unterschiedlichen Strahlungsregimen untersucht. Fur hochgradig koharente Strahlung wird eine iterative Beugungsbildgebungstechnik weiterentwickelt, die Phasenrekonstruktion auf einzelne Fernfeld-Beugungsmuster von hochfokussierten Pulsen anwendet. Ein Vergleich mit dem klassischen Wellenfront-Messverfahren nach Hartmann schafft hierbei Vertrauen in die Gultigkeit der neuentwickelten iterativen Methode. 
 
Fur partiell koha rente Pulse konvergiert die iterative Methode jedoch nicht. Daher wird ein verallgemeinerter iterativer Algorithmus entwickelt und demonstriert, der Konzepte der optischen Theorie partiell koharenter Rontgenstrahlen, basierend auf dem Schellschen Theorem, benutzt. Dieser Algorithmus erlaubt sowohl die Rekonstruktion des komplexen Wellenfeldes als auch eine Abschatzung der raumlichen Koharenz einzel- ner Pulse. Der so ermittelte Koharenzgrad in verschiedenen Strahlungsregimen ist in guter Ubereinstimmung mit Simulationen der FEL Strahleigenschaften. Im Vergleich zu herkommlichen Methoden wird hierbei der Koharenzgrad und andere Parameter des Wellenfeldes mit der geringstmoglichen Menge an verfugbarer Information, der Messung eines einzelnen zweidimensionalen Beugungsmusters, gewonnen. Diese bildgebenden Verfahren sind uber einen sehr breiten Bereich von Photonenenergien anwendbar, da keine absorbierenden optischen Elemente zwischen der fokussierenden Optik und dem Detektor benotigt sind. 
 
Als zusatzliche Information kann ferner die longitudinale Quellposition im aktiven Undulatorsegment aus beiden Algorithmen genau ermittelt werden. Dies liefert weiteren Aufschluss daruber wie die Maschinenparameter des FELs die optischen Eigenschaften des Rontgenstrahls beeinflussen. 
 
 
Free-Electron-Lasers (FELs) have enabled tremendous possibilities in x-ray science due to their ultrashort, highly intense and coherent radiation. At present, FELs rely pri- marily on the Self Amplified Spontaneous Emission process, which is of a stochastic nature, and emit pulses which may fluctuate drastically from shot to shot. Since many of the novel experiments at FELs require a high degree of beam focusing, in particular for imaging single non-crystalline biological particles, it is imperative to characterize the specific properties of single-shot focused complex wave fields versus different states of the FEL machine. Therefore, a deterministic approach applicable to various FEL operation regimes is desirable to enable the investigation of photon beam properties. The statis- tical evaluation of the determined properties over different ensembles of pulses leads to an understanding of and potentially optimization of the radiation to be delivered. 
 
In this thesis, I have studied different realizations and methods of focused wave field determination at beamline BL2 at the Free electron Laser At Hamburg (FLASH) for various radiation regimes. An iterative diffraction imaging technique has been developed to study highly coherent pulses. The method comprises of a phase retrieval algorithm applied to single far-field diffraction patterns of highly focused pulses. Also, the Hart- mann Wavefront Sensing method, as a classical approach, has been applied to measure photon beam properties in the same machine state. The comparison of results has built confidence in the validity of the imaging method. 
 
A transition to partially coherent radiation caused the algorithmic convergence of the iterative technique to fail. Therefore, a general iterative algorithm has been demon- strated based on Schell’s theorem to reconstruct single-shot complex wave fields, as well as estimating the spatial degree of coherence. The properties of measured pulses have been determined with the lowest level of available information compared to the conventional methods, as a single-shot 2D diffraction pattern measured in the far-field. These imaging methods are applicable across a very broad photon energy range since no absorptive optics are needed between the focusing optics and the detector. 
 
Additionally, the variation in longitudinal source position within the operating undula- tor segments has been determined precisely as feedback from both algorithms, providing further insight into how FEL machine parameters influence the optical properties of the photon beam.},

The Shannon sampling, defined by the transform of the periodically repeated autocorrelation of the object, is related to Bragg scattering from an equivalent crystal, and shown to be consistent with the sampling of Young's fringes established by scattering from extreme points in the object. The results are relevant to the design of diffraction cameras for CDI and plans for femotosecond X-ray diffraction from individual proteins.},

The assumption since the beginning has been that damage to the sample caused by intense X-ray pulses is one of the limiting factors for achieving subnanometer X-ray imaging of single particles and that X-ray pulses need to be as short as possible. Based on the molecular dynamics simulations of proteins in X-ray ﬁelds of various durations (5 fs, 25 fs, and 50 fs), we show that the noise in the diffracted signal caused by radiation damage is less than what can be expected from other sources, such as sample inhomogeneity and X-ray shot-to-shot variations. These ﬁndings show a different aspect of the feasibility of high-resolution single particle imaging using free-electron lasers, where employing X-ray pulses of longer durations could still provide a useful diffraction signal above the noise due to the Coulomb explosion.},

Addition of M uncorrelated speckle patterns on an intensity basis can reduce the contrast by 1/√M. However, addition of speckle patterns on a complex amplitude basis provides no reduction of contrast.

By replacing the mask apertures with transmission gratings at different orientations, we simultaneously detect harmonic wavefronts and spectra, and obtain sensitivity to spatiotemporal structure such as pulse front tilt as well.

	abstract = {We consider different approaches to simulate a modern X-ray beamline. Several methodologies with increasing complexity are applied to discuss the relevant parameters that quantify the beamline performance. Parameters such as flux, dimensions and intensity distribution of the focused beam and coherence properties are obtained from simple analytical calculations to sophisticated computer simulations using ray-tracing and wave optics techniques. A latest-generation X-ray nanofocusing beamline for coherent applications (ID16A at the ESRF) has been chosen to study in detail the issues related to highly demagnifying synchrotron sources and exploiting the beam coherence. The performance of the beamline is studied for two storage rings: the old ESRF-1 (emittance 4000{\textasciitilde}pm) and the new ESRF-EBS (emittance 150{\textasciitilde}pm). In addition to traditional results in terms of flux and beam sizes, an innovative study on the partial coherence properties based on the propagation of coherent modes is presented. The different algorithms and methodologies are implemented in the software suite OASYS. Those are discussed with emphasis placed upon the their benefits and limitations of each.},

	abstract = {Optical communication is an integral part of the modern economy, having all but replaced electronic communication systems. Future growth in bandwidth appears to be on the horizon using structured light, encoding information into the spatial modes of light, and transmitting them down fibre and free-space, the latter crucial for addressing last mile and digitally disconnected communities. Unfortunately, patterns of light are easily distorted, and in the case of free-space optical communication, turbulence is a significant barrier. Here we review recent progress in structured light in turbulence, first with a tutorial style summary of the core concepts, before highlighting the present state-of-the-art in the field. We support our review with new experimental studies that reveal which types of structured light are best in turbulence, the behaviour of vector versus scalar light in turbulence, the trade-off of diversity and multiplexing, and how turbulence models can be exploited for enhanced optical signal processing protocols. This comprehensive treatise will be invaluable to the large communities interested in free-space optical communication with spatial modes of light.},

	abstract = {The flourishing of topological photonics in the last decade was achieved mainly due to developments in linear topological photonic structures. However, when nonlinearity is introduced, many intriguing questions arise. For example, are there universal fingerprints of underlying topology when modes are coupled by nonlinearity, and what can happen to topological invariants during nonlinear propagation? To explore these questions, here we experimentally demonstrate nonlinearity-induced coupling to topologically protected edge states using a photonic platform, and theoretically develop a general framework for interpreting the mode-coupling dynamics in nonlinear topological systems. Performed in laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices, our experiments reveal nonlinear coupling of light into a nontrivial edge or interface defect channel otherwise not permissible due to topological protection. Our theory explains well all the observations. Furthermore, we introduce the concepts of inherited and emergent nonlinear topological phenomena, and a protocol capable of unveiling the interplay of nonlinearity and topology. These concepts are applicable for other nonlinear topological systems, either in higher dimensions or beyond our photonic platform.},

For the cases of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and attractor dimension the simple dimensional predictions are found to be insufficient.

The motivation for this paper is primarily to deﬁne what an attractor is and to clarify what distinguishes its various types (nonstrange, strange nonchaotic, and strange chaotic).

The package has been developed at European XFEL for users at the existing and emerging free-electron laser (FEL) facilities, as well as at the third-generation synchrotron sources and future diffraction-limited storage rings. The

The framework runs reliably under Linux, Microsoft Windows 7 and Apple Mac OS X and is distributed under an open-source license. The available tools allow for varying source parameters and optics layouts and visualizing the results interactively. The wavefront history structure can be used for tracking changes in every particular wavefront during propagation. The batch propagation mode enables processing of multiple wavefronts in workflow mode. The paper presents a general description of the package and gives some recent application examples, including modeling of full X-ray FEL beamlines and start-to-end simulation of experiments.},

These phase screens are generated on a numerical grid of finite size, which corresponds to a rather narrow slice (spatial area) of atmospheric turbulence. In several important applications including laser target tracking, remote sensing, adaptive optics, and atmospheric imaging, optical system performance depends on atmospheric turbulence within an extended area that significantly exceeds the area associated with the numerical grid. In this paper we discuss methods that allow the generation of a family of long (including infinitely long) phase screens representing an extended (in one direction) area of atmospheric turbulence-induced phase distortions. This technique also allows the generation of long phase screens with spatially inhomogeneous statistical characteristics.},

So far, the probes were assumed to be completely known (amplitude, wavefront, state of polarization), which is rarely the case in practice. Here we address the issue of the joint estimating of the set of polarized illumination probes together with the Jones matrix of an anisotropic object in vectorial ptychography. We propose an algorithm based on a conjugate gradient strategy. Experimental results are reported, showing an improvement on the object estimate, in addition to a precise reconstruction of the probes.},

	abstract = {The Fokker--Planck Equation can be used in a partially-coherent imaging context to model the evolution of the intensity of a paraxial x-ray wave field with propagation. This forms a natural generalisation of the transport-of-intensity equation. The x-ray Fokker--Planck equation can simultaneously account for both propagation-based phase contrast, and the diffusive effects of sample-induced small-angle x-ray scattering, when forming an x-ray image of a thin sample. Two derivations are given for the Fokker--Planck equation associated with x-ray imaging, together with a Kramers--Moyal generalisation thereof. Both equations are underpinned by the concept of unresolved speckle due to unresolved sample micro-structure. These equations may be applied to the forward problem of modelling image formation in the presence of both coherent and diffusive energy transport. They may also be used to formulate associated inverse problems of retrieving the phase shifts due to a sample placed in an x-ray beam, together with the diffusive properties of the sample. The domain of applicability for the Fokker--Planck and Kramers--Moyal equations for paraxial imaging is at least as broad as that of the transport-of-intensity equation which they generalise, hence the technique is also expected to be useful for paraxial imaging using visible light, electrons and neutrons.},

Aiming at future practical uses of X-ray ghost imaging, the authors discuss details regarding data acquisition, image reconstruction strategies and measure the point-spread function of the ghost-imaging system. This approach may become relevant for applications of ghost imaging with X-ray sources such as undulators in storage rings, free-electron lasers and lower-coherence laboratory facilities.},

There is a paucity of rigorous definitions for these quantities, which are general enough to be useful in a broad range of imaging problems, while being also sufficiently specific to enable precise quantitative evaluation of the relevant properties of imaging systems. This is particularly true for many modern forms of imaging that include digital processing of the acquired imaging data as an integral step leading to final images presented to an end-user. Here, both the well-known historical definitions of spatial resolution and some more recent approaches suitable for many forms of modern computational imaging are discussed. An intrinsic duality of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise exists in almost all types of imaging, with the related uncertainty relationship determining a trade-off between the two quantities. Examples are presented with applications to super-resolution imaging, inline holography and ghost imaging.},

These results are obtained by reducing the electron bunch charge while at same time maximizing the beam brightness and reducing the bunch length to a value near or smaller than the free-electron laser cooperation length. In the last case the radiation pulse is fully coherent in the longitudinal and transverse space. The increase in beam brightness can also be used to reduce the beam energy needed for a given radiation wavelength, when, at the same time, the undulator period is reduced. The simultaneous decrease in beam energy and undulator period leads to a more compact free-electron laser, while the high beam brightness reduces the gain length and increases the coherent radiation intensity.},

The effect of the beam defining aperture, typically used in combination with focusing elements at synchrotron sources to improve transverse coherence, is also analyzed in detail. As an example the coherence properties in the focal region of compound refractive lenses at the PETRA III synchrotron source are analyzed.},

	abstract = {When observing from the ground one has to deal with the turbulence from the atmosphere and the turbulence caused by the telescope's surroundings. In order to find the best sites for future solar telescopes and develop multi-conjugate adaptive optics (MCAO) for them, the contributions to seeing have to be characterized for heights up to at least 12 km above the telescope.   This characterization is done with a method that measures differential image displacements using several subapertures. By extending the ordinary DIMM- and S-DIMM-methods to measure displacements at different field angles, the height distribution of seeing can be measured. This extended method is called S-DIMM+, where the letter S denotes the use of the Sun as source and the + signifies that it is an extension of the former methods.   Observations are made with the Wide Field Wavefront Sensor (WFWFS) mounted at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) at La Palma. The results from these measurements are compared with the Shadow Band Ranger (SHABAR), also mounted on the SST.   The first results of these comparisons show good correlation between the two instruments for heights up to 500 m. Results from the WFWFS also show that the dominant seeing at this site comes from layers close to the ground and at high altitude and that Fried's parameter, r\_0, is larger than 40 cm for the intermediate layers.},

	abstract = {Coherent ptychographic imaging experiments often discard the majority of the flux from a light source to define the coherence of the illumination. Even when the coherent flux is sufficient, the stability required during an exposure is another important limiting factor. Partial coherence analysis can considerably reduce these limitations. A partially coherent illumination can often be written as the superposition of a single coherent illumination convolved with a separable translational kernel. This article proposes the gradient decomposition of the probe (GDP), a model that exploits translational kernel separability, coupling the variances of the kernel with the transverse coherence. An efficient first-order splitting algorithm (
              GDP-ADMM
              ) for solving the proposed nonlinear optimization problem is described. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with Gaussian and binary kernel functions in fly-scan measurements. Remarkably,
              GDP-ADMM
              using nanoprobes produces satisfactory results even when the ratio between the kernel width and the beam size is more than one, or when the distance between successive acquisitions is twice as large as the beam width.},

The synthesis procedure of these beams relies on the incoherent superposition of their coherent modes being Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) functions having a variable radial mode and a fixed azimuthal mode carrying the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM). As a result of such construction the correlation functions of these random beams have separable phase carrying the OAM with the index inherited from the coherent modes. The coherence states of these beams are controlled by the distribution of weights of the coherent modes in superposition, varying from perfectly coherent to nearly incoherent. We explore the effects of the cycling rates of the SLM and the DMD used for source synthesis on the average intensity and the scintillation index of the generated beams having different OAM indices and coherence states after propagation in atmospheric turbulence. Our analysis indicates that for fairly incoherent beams with sufficiently large OAM index and high cycling rates the atmospheric turbulence can be efficiently mitigated.},

Computational methods proved to be immensely successful in understanding protein dynamics in solution, and they continue to improve in terms of both the scale and the types of systems that can be studied. In this review, we brieﬂy discuss the limitations of X-ray crystallography in studying protein dynamics, and then provide an overview of different computational methods that are instrumental in understanding the dynamics of proteins and biomacromolecular complexes.},

Wavelengths between λ = 32 nm and λ = 8 nm are examined. A decrease of the coherence time for the fundamental wavelengths from τc = (6 ± 0.5) fs at 32 nm to τc = (2.9 ± 0.5) fs at 8 nm is measured. At λ = 8 nm the fundamental wavelength and the third harmonic of 24 nm are compared to each other. For 8 nm radiation as third harmonic of 24 nm a coherence time of τc = (2.5 ± 0.5) fs is observed. The spatial coherence of 24 nm and 8 nm fundamental pulses are found to be very similar. The visibility decreases to 50\% of the maximum visibility at about 3.2 mm overlap of the partial beams, which corresponds to 42\% of the beam diameter (FWHM) at a distance of 90 m from the exit of the undulator. These results are analysed in terms of the Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) resulting in six contributing modes to the total radiation. In addition, the correlation of the visibility between the fundamental radiation at 24 nm and its third harmonic at λ = 8 nm is investigated for identical shots.},

As a result, the developed code allows one to use a personal computer for time-dependent simulations. The code allows one to simulate the radiation from the electron bunch of any transverse and longitudinal bunch shape; to simulate simultaneously an external seed with superimposed noise in the electron beam; to take into account energy spread in the electron beam and the space charge "elds; and to simulate a high-gain, high-e\$ciency FEL ampli"er with a tapered undulator.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01452},
	abstract = {X-ray imaging has conventionally relied upon attenuation to provide contrast. In recent years, two complementary modalities have been added; a) phase contrast, which can capture low-density samples that are difﬁcult to see using attenuation, and b) dark-ﬁeld x-ray imaging, which reveals the presence of sub-pixel sample structures. These three modalities can be accessed using a crystal analyser, a grating interferometer or by looking at a directly-resolved grid, grating or speckle pattern. Grating and grid-based methods extract a differential phase signal by measuring how far a feature in the illumination has been shifted transversely due to the presence of a sample. The dark-ﬁeld signal is extracted by measuring how the visibility of the structured illumination is decreased, typically due to the presence of sub-pixel structures in a sample. The strength of the dark-ﬁeld signal may depend on the grating period, the pixel size and the set-up distances, and additional dark-ﬁeld signal contributions may be seen as a result of strong phase effects or other factors. In this paper we show that the ﬁnite-difference form of the Fokker–Planck equation can be applied to describe the drift (phase signal) and diffusion (dark-ﬁeld signal) of the periodic or structured illumination used in phase contrast x-ray imaging with gratings, in order to better understand any cross-talk between attenuation, phase and dark-ﬁeld x-ray signals. In future work, this mathematical description could be used as a basis for new approaches to the inverse problem of recovering both phase and dark-ﬁeld information.},

These speckles are generated by passing x rays through a suitable spatially random mask. The method makes use of a single image obtained in the presence of the object, which serves to deform the illuminating speckle field relative to a reference speckle field (which need only be measured once) obtained in the presence of the mask and the absence of the object. The method implicitly rather than explicitly tracks speckles, and utilizes the transport-of-intensity equation to give a closed-form solution to the inverse problem of determining the complex transmission function of the object. Application to x-ray synchrotron data shows the method to be robust and efficient with respect to noise. Applications include x-ray phase--amplitude radiography and tomography, as well as time-dependent imaging of dynamic and radiation-sensitive samples using low-flux sources.},

Besides covering fundamental concepts in both theory and practice, we also give opinions on future trends in X-ray phase contrast imaging including X-ray tomography, and comparison of different phase contrast imaging methods.

	abstract = {A simple model for image formation in linear shift-invariant systems is considered, in which both the detected signal and the noise variance are varying slowly compared to the point-spread function of the system. It is shown that within the constraints of this model, the square of the signal-to-noise ratio is always proportional to the “volume” of the spatial resolution unit. In the case of Poisson statistics, the ratio of these two quantities divided by the incident density of the imaging particles (e.g. photons) represents a dimensionless invariant of the imaging system, which was previously termed the intrinsic imaging quality. The relationship of this invariant to the notion of information capacity of communication and imaging systems, which was previously considered by Shannon, Gabor and others, is investigated. The results are then applied to a simple generic model of quantitative imaging of weakly scattering objects, leading to an estimate of the upper limit for the amount of information about the sample that can be obtained in such experiments. It is shown that this limit depends only on the total number of imaging particles incident on the sample, the average scattering coefficient, the size of the sample and the number of spatial resolution units.},

	abstract = {The notions of spatial resolution and signal-to-noise are central to most forms of imaging. However, it appears that rigorous definitions of these quantities, which would be general enough to be useful in a broad range of imaging problems, while being also sufficiently specific to enable precise quantitative evaluation of the relevant properties of imaging systems, have been somewhat lacking. This is particularly true in respect to many modern forms of imaging that include digital processing of the acquired imaging data as an integral step leading to final images presented to the enduser. In the present paper, both the well-known historical definitions of spatial resolution and some more recent approaches suitable for many modern computational imaging techniques are discussed. An intrinsic duality of the spatial resolution and signal-to-noise exists in almost all types of imaging, with the related uncertainty relationship determining the inevitable trade-offs between the two quantities. Examples are presented with applications to some forms of X-ray imaging. Relations to Shannon and Fisher information capacity of imaging systems and super-resolution are also briefly discussed.},

However, most implementations developed to take advantage of this framework revolve around controlling the measurements with carefully engineered material or acquisition sequences. Instead, we use the natural randomness of wave propagation through multiply scattering media as an optimal and instantaneous compressive imaging mechanism. Waves reflected from an object are detected after propagation through a well-characterized complex medium. Each local measurement thus contains global information about the object, yielding a purely analog compressive sensing method. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for optical imaging by using a 300-micrometer thick layer of white paint as the compressive imaging device. Scattering media are thus promising candidates for designing efficient and compact compressive imagers.},

Comparisons with respect to computational time and prediction performance via functional cross-validation is evaluated, mainly through a simulation study but also on a real data set. We restrict comparisons to Sp.T. kriging versus ordinary kriging for functional data (OKFD), since the more ﬂexible functional kriging approaches pointwise functional kriging (PWFK) and the functional kriging total model coincide with OKFD in several situations. Here we formulate conditions under which we show that OKFD and PWFK coincide. From the simulation study, it is concluded that the prediction performance of the two kriging approaches in general is rather equal for stationary Sp.T. processes. However, functional kriging tends to perform better for small sample sizes, while Sp.T. kriging works better for large sizes. For non-stationary Sp.T. processes, with a common deterministic time trend and/or time varying variances and dependence structure, OKFD performs better than Sp.T. kriging irrespective of the sample size. For all simulated cases, the computational time for OKFD was considerably lower compared to those for the Sp.T. kriging methods.},

	abstract = {Arbitrary distributions of radiant exposure may be written by transversely scanning a single known spatially-random screen that is normally illuminated by spatially but not necessarily temporally uniform radiation or matter wave fields. The arbitrariness, of the written pattern of radiant exposure, holds up to both (i) a spatial resolution that is dictated by the characteristic transverse length scale of the illuminated spatially random screen, and (ii) a background term that grows linearly with the number of random-illumination patterns. Two classes of the method are developed. The former assumes the distance between the illuminated random mask and the target plane to be sufficiently small that the effects of diffraction may be neglected. The latter accounts for the effects of Fresnel diffraction in the regime of large Fresnel number. Numerical simulations are provided for both variants of the method. Contrast and signal-to-noise ratio are also considered. The method may be parallelized, and is suited to both magnifying and de-magnifying geometries. Possible applications include spatial light modulators and intensity projectors for those matter and radiation wave fields for which such devices do not exist, printing or micro-fabrication in both two and three spatial dimensions, and lithography.},

Here we present three-dimensional quantitative images of a whole eukaryotic cell by FCDI at a spatial resolution below 70 nm with sufficient phase contrast to distinguish major cellular components. From our data, we estimate that the minimum dose required for a similar resolution is close to that predicted by the Rose criterion, considerably below accepted estimates of the maximum dose a frozen-hydrated cell can tolerate. Based on the dose efficiency, contrast, and resolution achieved, we expect this technique will find immediate applications in tomographic cellular characterisation.},

The first is the 3D structural determination of noncrystalline materials, which includes the localization of the defects and strain field inside nanocrystals, and quantitative 3D imaging of disordered materials such as nanoparticles and biomaterials. The second is the 3D imaging of frozen-hydrated whole cells at a resolution of 10 nm or better. A main thrust is to localize specific multiprotein complexes inside cells. The third is the potential of imaging single large protein complexes using extremely intense and ultrashort X-ray pulses.

The rapid growth of interest in using the beam since that time and the growth of other facilities using high-energy storage rings (see Chapters 1 and 3) demonstrates how the users of this source of radiation are finding applications in an increasingly wide variety of fields of science and technology. In assembling the list of authors for this book, we have tried to cover as many of the applications of synchrotron radiation, both realized already or in the process of realization, as we can. Inevitably, there are omissions both through lack of space and because many projects are at an early stage.

Naulleau, 1 Dimitra Niakoula, 1 and Guojing Zhang 2 Center for X-Ray Optics, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA 94720 Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA 95052 Abstract As critical dimensions shrink, line edge and width roughness (LER and LWR) become of increasing concern. Traditionally LER is viewed as a resist-limited effect; however, as critical dimensions shrink and LER requirements become proportionally more stringent, system-level effects begin to play an important role. Recent advanced EUV resist testing results have demonstrated lower bounds on achievable LER at the level of approximately 2 to 3 nm. Here we use modeling to demonstrate that a significant portion of this low bound may in fact be do to system-level effects and in particular the mask. Of concern are both LER on the mask as well as roughness of the multilayer reflector. Modeling also shows roughness (flare) in the projection optics not to be of concern.

	abstract = {In the case of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, modeling has shown that reflector phase roughness on the lithographic mask is a significant concern due to the image plane speckle it causes and the resulting line-edge roughness on imaged features. Modeling results have recently been used to determine the requirements for future production worthy masks yielding the extremely stringent specification of 50 pm rms roughness. Owing to the scale of the problem in terms of memory requirements, past modeling results have been based on the thin mask approximation in this application. EUV masks, however, are inherently three-dimensional (3D) in nature and thus the question arises as to the validity of the thin mask approximation. Here, we directly compare the image plane speckle calculation results using the fast two-dimensional thin mask model to rigorous finite-difference time-domain results and find the two methods to agree to within 10\% in the computation of the speckle magnitude and 20\% in the computation of the line-edge roughness limited depth of focus. For both types of computation, the two-dimensional method provides a conservative estimate. The 3D modeling is also used to show that layer-to-layer correlated roughness is indeed the roughness metric of most concern.},

Starting from the statistical optics and using mutual coherence function of the radiation ﬁeld, we deﬁne the transverse and temporal coherence and modes. Spectral brightness can be represented in radiation phase-space via the Wigner function which is the Fourier transformation of the transverse correlation function. The brightness convolution theorem can be employed to calculate the total source brightness and the degree of transverse coherence of the radiation emitted by an electron beam. Undulator radiation possesses partial transverse coherence until the beam emittances can be reduced below the diffraction limit. For x-ray FELs the radiation has excellent transverse coherence and at least 9 orders of magnitude enhancement in peak brightness. Seeding can further improve temporal coherence of FELs. Future development includes diffraction limited light sources, higher peak and average power x-ray FELs and compact coherent radiation sources based on laser and plasma accelerators.},

In this paper, two EUV mask blanks with known native buried phase defects were characterized with a Lasertec M7360 (266 nm wavelength), atomic force microscope (AFM), and SEMATECH’s actinic inspection tool (AIT), which is an EUV-wavelength microscope. The results show that there are various kinds of native defects on the mask blank. Not surprisingly, the surface height and measured EUV intensity profile of real blank defects can differ significantly from Gaussian-shaped defects. All defects found by the M7360 were observable in the AIT, yet many do not perturb the intensity enough to be printable in isolation. This paper shows that defects come in various sizes and types and clarifies what must be done to learn more about real defect printability to achieve defect-free mask blanks.},

	abstract = {Stochastic effects in lithography are usually quantified through local CD variability metrics, such as line-width roughness or local CD uniformity (LCDU), and these quantities have been measured and studied intensively, both in EUV and optical lithography. Next to the CD-variability, stochastic effects can also give rise to local, random printing failures, such as missing contacts or microbridges in spaces. When these occur, there often is no (reliable) CD to be measured locally, and then such failures cannot be quantified with the usual CD-measuring techniques. We have developed algorithms to detect such stochastic printing failures in regular line/space (L/S) or contact- or dot-arrays from SEM images, leading to a stochastic failure metric that we call NOK (not OK), which we consider a complementary metric to the CD-variability metrics. This paper will show how both types of metrics can be used to experimentally quantify dependencies of stochastic effects to, e.g., CD, pitch, resist, exposure dose, etc. As it is also important to be able to predict upfront (in the OPC verification stage of a production-mask tape-out) whether certain structures in the layout are likely to have a high sensitivity to stochastic effects, we look into the feasibility of constructing simple predictors, for both stochastic CD-variability and printing failure, that can be calibrated for the process and exposure conditions used and integrated into the standard OPC verification flow. Finally, we briefly discuss the options to reduce stochastic variability and failure, considering the entire patterning ecosystem.},

The short wavelength of the incident illumination allows for a considerable decrease in printed feature size, but also creates a range of technological challenges not present for traditional optical lithography. Contamination and oxidation form on multilayer reﬂecting optics surfaces that not only reduce system throughput because of the associated reduction in EUV reﬂectivity, but also introduce wavefront aberrations that compromise the ability to print uniform features. Capping layers of ruthenium, ﬁlms \$2 nm thick, are found to extend the lifetime of Mo/Si multilayer mirrors used in EUV lithography applications. However, reﬂectivities of even the Ru-coated mirrors degrade in time during exposure to EUV radiation. Ruthenium surfaces are chemically reactive and are very effective as heterogeneous catalysts. In the present paper we summarize the thermal and radiation-induced surface chemistry of bare Ru exposed to gases; the emphasis is on H2O vapor, a dominant background gas in vacuum processing chambers. Our goal is to provide insights into the fundamental physical processes that affect the reﬂectivity of Ru-coated Mo/Si multilayer mirrors exposed to EUV radiation. Our ultimate goal is to identify and recommend practices or antidotes that may extend mirror lifetimes.},

This approach produces results indistinguishable from methods such as coupled wave theory, and it allows one to reproduce other X-ray optical phenomena such as grazing incidence reﬂectivity where the direction of energy ﬂow is changed signiﬁcantly. Just as ﬁnite element analysis methods allow engineers to compute the thermal and mechanical responses of arbitrary structures too complex to model by analytical approaches, multislice propagation can be used to understand the properties of the real-world optics of ﬁnite extent and with local imperfections, allowing one to better understand the limits to nanoscale X-ray imaging.},

	abstract = {Arbitrary intensity distributions may be written by transversely scanning a single spatially-random screen that is normally illuminated by spatially but not necessarily temporally uniform radiation or matter wave fields. The arbitrariness, of the written pattern, holds up to both (i) a spatial resolution that is dictated by the characteristic transverse length scale of the illuminated spatially random screen, and (ii) an additive constant. Two forms of the method are developed. The former assumes the distance between the illuminated random mask and the target plane to be sufficiently small that the effects of diffraction may be neglected. The latter accounts for the effects of Fresnel diffraction in the regime of large Fresnel number. Numerical simulations are provided for both variants of the method. The method may be parallelized, and is also suited to both magnifying and de-magnifying geometries. Possible applications include spatial light modulators and intensity projectors for those matter and radiation fields for which such devices do not exist, printing/micro-fabrication in both two and three spatial dimensions, and lithography.},

	abstract = {We have investigated the thermal and radiation chemistry of an organotin-based model photoresist to elucidate patterning mechanisms related to extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. Butyltin oxide hydroxide (BuSnOOH) was dissolved in organic solvents and spin-coated to form uniform thin films. The thermal stability and radiation sensitivity of the thin films were characterized by temperature programmed desorption (TPD), electron stimulated desorption (ESD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From the TPD studies, we determined that decomposition of BuSnOOH occurs at {\textasciitilde}653 K through cleavage of the butyl-tin bond. Low kinetic energy electron (Ekin = 80 eV) and X-ray (1486.6 eV) exposure also resulted in cleavage of the butyl-tin bond with the resulting desorption of butyl ligands from the film. From the ESD data, we estimated that the butyl ligand desorption cross section was {\textasciitilde}4.3 × 10−14 cm2 for electrons with 80 eV kinetic energy. From the XPS results, we found a significant reduction in C 1s intensity for extended X-ray exposures, which corresponds to butyl ligand loss. There were also changes in the O 1s spectra indicating loss of hydroxyl groups and tin oxide network formation during radiation exposure. These results indicate the preferential dissociation and desorption of butyl ligands that can occur through either thermal or radiation induced processes, and that butyl ligand loss leads to the solubility contrast.},

This model is used to describe coherence properties of the five meter undulator source at the synchrotron storage ring PETRA III. In the case of XFEL sources the decomposition of the statistical fields into a sum of independently propagating transverse modes is used for the analysis of the coherence properties of these new sources. A detailed calculation is performed for the parameters of the SASE1 undulator at the European XFEL. It is demonstrated that only a few modes contribute significantly to the total radiation field of that source.},

The measurement of modulation transfer function of critical dimension (CD) is main performance parameter to evaluate the line width of semiconductor platform fabricating ability for the smallest line width of producing tiny integrated circuits. Although the modulation transfer function (MTF) has been popularly used to evaluation the optical system, but in lithography, the contrast of each line-pair is in one dimension or two dimensions, analytically, while the lens stand along in the test bench integrated with the light source coherent or near coherent for the small dimension near the optical diffraction limit, the MTF is not only contributed by the lens, also by illumination of platform. In the study, the partial coherence modulation transfer function (PCMTF) for testing a lithography lens is suggested by measuring MTF in the high spatial frequency of in situ lithography lens, blended with the illumination of partial and in coherent light source. PCMTF can be one of measurement to evaluate the imperfect lens of lithography lens for further improvement in lens performance.},

In the basic design, the transformer primary circuit consists of two copper plates connected by a conductive tube at the center. The primary current flows radially in on one plate, axially through the central connection, and radially outward through the second plate. The induced secondary currents flow in a plasma through three electrically parallel paths that pierce the primary structure in three places (the plasma return holes), and then combine in the central bore. Figure 4.1 shows this geometry. Sandwiched between the plates are two magnetic cores. The inner core, closely surrounding the central bore, provides the magnetic flux linkage between the primary current path through the copper and the three parallel secondary currents flowing in the plasma, which combine in the bore to generate the magnetic Z-pinch. The second core is near the outer radius of the device and surrounds the three plasma return holes. This core functions as a magnetic switch with a specific volt-second capacity matched to the capacitance and charging system described below. Figure A4.2 shows a crosssection of the structure.},

              , a browser-based GUI for X-ray source and optics simulations, is presented. Such calculations can be performed using
              SRW
              (
              Synchrotron Radiation Workshop
              ), which is a physical optics computer code, allowing simulation of entire experimental beamlines using the concept of a `virtual beamline' with accurate treatment of synchrotron radiation generation and propagation through the X-ray optical system.
              SRW
              is interfaced with
              Sirepo
              by means of a Python application programming interface.
              Sirepo
              supports most of the optical elements currently used at beamlines, including recent developments in
              SRW
              . In particular, support is provided for the simulation of state-of-the-art X-ray beamlines, exploiting the high coherence and brightness of modern light source facilities. New scientific visualization and reporting capabilities have been recently implemented within
              Sirepo
              , as well as automatic determination of electron beam and undulator parameters. Publicly available community databases can be dynamically queried for error-free access to material characteristics. These computational tools can be used for the development and commissioning of new X-ray beamlines and for testing feasibility and optimization of experiments. The same interface can guide simulation on a local computer, a remote server or a high-performance cluster.
              Sirepo
              is available online and also within the NSLS-II firewall, with a growing number of users at other light source facilities. Our open source code is available on GitHub.},

The Coherent Hard X-ray (CHX) beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) is exploiting the coherent flux to enable best-in-class time-resolved coherent scattering techniques such as X-ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (XPCS) or X-ray Speckle Visibility Spectroscopy (XSVS). Based on the commissioning results, a realistic simulation of the whole beamline, including source and optics, has been performed leveraging a ‘virtual beamline’ module of the ‘Synchrotron Radiation Workshop’ (SRW) code in a web browser based interface to the code named ‘Sirepo’. This virtual beamline capability is used here to simulate partially coherent small angle scattering patterns of samples relevant to the CHX science case, mimicking ‘detector images’ of real experiments. Such source-to-detector simulations of experiments allow for an accurate estimation of feasibility of a given experiment, for an optimization of the beamline setup and interpretation of experimental results.},

The method assumes that it is possible to freely and independently rotate the separate 2D transverse phase spaces in the horizontal and vertical directions. Using images of the beam that would be captured on a screen, we develop a mathematical procedure that will reconstruct the full 4D particle distribution. We simulate this procedure for a hypothetical distribution and show that the reconstruction agrees with the actual distribution. Finally, we demonstrate for the practical case of a two-quadrupole setup that it is indeed possible to adjust the quadrupole strengths so that the separate 2D transverse phase spaces can be rotated independently. However, in this setup, the rotation angles are restricted to smaller ranges. Even so, the reconstructed results reproduce the actual distribution clearly.},

We show here that measuring the complex spatial coherence function can help in the identiﬁcation of the size and location of a one-dimensional object placed in the path of a partially coherent light source. The complex coherence function is measured in the far ﬁeld through wavefront sampling, which is performed via dynamically reconﬁgurable slits implemented on a digital micromirror device (DMD). The impact of an object – parameterized by size and location – that either intercepts or reﬂects incoherent light is studied. The experimental results show that measuring the spatial coherence function as a function of the separation between two slits located symmetrically around the optical axis can identify the object transverse location and angle subtended from the detection plane (the ratio of the object width to the axial distance from the detector). The measurements are in good agreement with numerical simulations of a forward model based on Fresnel propagators. The rapid refresh rate of DMDs may enable real-time operation of such a lensless coherency imaging scheme.},

Previous experiments have focused mainly on coherent beams, which are fully described by a two-dimensional complex field (amplitude and phase). In contrast, partially coherent beams inherently have more degrees of freedom and require a four-dimensional description. This description is particularly important for propagation, in which coherence properties determine the intensity evolution. Despite this, most measurements in linear optics, and all those in nonlinear optics, have recorded only the intensity and power spectrum projections (x-space or k-space only). Measuring local coherence remains a challenging problem, especially in the full four-dimensional phase space. In turn, the recording difficulty has limited efforts to generate arbitrary, spatially varying patterns of coherence, despite their usefulness for imaging, illumination and display. We remedy both problems here, using spatial light modulators to create beams with locally varying spatial coherence and to measure their phase-space properties.},

Depending on the choice and composition of target the EUV spectra can be dominated by line, unresolved transition array (UTA) or continuum emission. Line and UTA emission have found application in various proposed EUV sources for lithography, which is based on the availability of mirrors with high reflectivity in a 2\% bandwidth at a wavelength of 13.5 nm. The results of recent experimental measurements of absolute in-band and out of band intensity, ion distribution and debris are presented. It was found that because of opacity effects, the conversion efficiency is sensitive to ion density and laser wavelength. Various schemes to improve the conversion efficiency are discussed as are the results of recent plasma modelling calculations.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0506231},
	abstract = {This paper describes a theory of transverse coherence properties of Undulator Radiation. Our study is of very practical relevance, because it yields specific predictions of Undulator Radiation cross-spectral density in various parts of the beamline. On the contrary, usual estimations of coherence properties assume that the undulator source is quasi-homogeneous, like thermal sources, and rely on the application of van Cittert-Zernike (VCZ) theorem, in its original or generalized form, for calculating transverse coherence length in the far-field approximation. The VCZ theorem is derived in the frame of Statistical Optics using a number of restrictive assumptions: in particular, the quasi-homogeneous assumption is demonstrated to be inaccurate in many practical situations regarding undulator sources. We propose a technique to calculate the cross-spectral density from undulator sources in the most general case. Also, we find the region of applicability of the quasi-homogeneous model and we present an analytical expression for the cross-spectral density which is valid up to the exit of the undulator. For the case of more general undulator sources, simple formulas for the transverse coherence length, interpolated from numerical calculations and suitable for beamline design applications are found. Finally, using a simple vertical slit, we show how transverse coherence properties of an X-ray beam can be manipulated to obtain a larger coherent spot-size on a sample. This invention was devised almost entirely on the basis of theoretical ideas developed throughout this paper.},

Then, the brightness includes information on both coherence and wavefront characteristics of the radiation field. For undulator sources, it is customary to approximate the single-electron electric field at resonance with a Gaussian beam, leading to great simplifications. Attempts to account for the modified spatial and angular profile of the undulator radiation in the presence of detuning due to energy spread, currently build on the simplified brightness expression derived under the assumption of Gaussian beams. The influence of energy spread on undulator radiation properties is becoming important in view of diffraction-limited rings with ultralow emittance coming on-line. Here the effects of energy spread on the brightness of undulator radiation at resonance are discussed, as well as relevant relations with coherence properties.},

These two coherence properties are measured for various light sources of diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser, laser diode (LD), light emitting diode (LED), super luminescent light emitting diode (sLED) and micro light emitting diode (mLED) in different settings, together with the quality of the holographic reconstructed images. Although the image sharpness and speckle are related to both coherence parameters, our results and subsequent analysis show that the spatial coherence can be linked directly to the image sharpness and the temporal coherence to the speckle. This will provide a quantitative way not only to optimize the image quality between uniformity and sharpness but also to determine the safety power level for different light sources when viewing the produced images by human eyes directly.},

Experimentally it is verified to what extent measured and tabulated optical constants are applicable for simulations of the reflectivity of these short period multilayer mirrors. The measured maximum reflectance at various wavelength values around the boron-K absorption edge is compared to calculated values from model systems. The measured reflectance profiles of La/B and La/B4C show a maximum at a slightly larger wavelength than calculations would predict based on the measured B and B4C optical constants. This is explained by the influence of a formed boron-lanthanum compound on the wavelength where the multilayer shows maximum reflectance. The maximum reflectance profiles of LaN/B and LaN/B4C multilayers can be described accurately by using the same boron atomic scattering factors, indicating boron in the LaN/B4C multilayer to be in a similar chemical state as boron in the LaN/B multilayer. It also indicates that nitridation of the La layer in the multilayer prevents the formation of La-B compounds. We show that the optimal wavelength for boron based optics is about 6.65 nm and depends on the B chemical state. Finally, using the measured B optical constants we are able to calculate the spectral response of the multilayers, enabling the prediction of the optimal parameters for the above mentioned multilayers ©2012 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (340.7480) X-rays, soft x-rays, extreme ultraviolet (EUV); (340.7470) X-ray mirrors.},

In the laboratory these measurements are challenging due to the polychromaticity and lack of tunability of the source. Here we demonstrate how newly developed, high-resolution, energy-discriminating area detector technology can be exploited to enhance elemental contrast. The detector we employ here is the Pixirad area detector which can simultaneously have up to four separate colour channels.

This paper develops a new and powerful approach to computational lithography by introducing an information theoretical channel modeling in partially coherent lithography systems. A statistical model is built up based on the lithography imaging model to characterize the information transfer between the mask and print images. Then, this paper calculates the optimal information transfer (OIT) in partially coherent lithography systems, and derives the theoretical limit of image ﬁdelity for optical proximity correction (OPC), which is used extensively in computational lithography. Finally, the proposed information theoretical approaches are applied to improve the OPC solutions obtained by the gradient-based algorithm. A set of simulations are provided to verify the proposed information theoretical model and approaches.},

	abstract = {Advances in computational lithography over the last 10 years have been instrumental to the continued scaling of semiconductor devices. Competitive scaling requires two types of complementary models: fast predictive empirical models that can be used for pattern correction and verification; rigorous physical models that can be used to identify key physical effects that must be considered to ensure pattern fidelity, but are too resource intensive to use for full chip applications. Today, all computational lithography efforts such as the optical proximity correction (OPC) and the optical rules check (ORC) depend on the ability to predictively model the lithography and metrology processes. We discuss some of the current modeling practices in optics, mask, resist and etching, leading to the “Holy Grail” of predictively modeling entire patterning process which we call “virtual fab”. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) modeling is discussed due to its potential to extend optical lithography scaling for future nodes. Modeling of novel technologies such as Diblock Copolymer patterning is also discussed to demonstrate new opportunities for continued scaling. Complexity of the “virtual fab” approach is extremely high as there are multiple dimensions in this approach. The need to overcome this complexity, by reducing the number of dimensions of the problem, is evident. Lastly, the ability to leverage lithography modeling in design co-optimization is an important element of semiconductor device scaling.},

	abstract = {Lithography tools are being built and shipped to semiconductor manufacturers for high volume manufacturing using extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) at a wavelength of 13.5 nm. This wavelength is based on the availability of Mo/Si multilayer mirrors (MLMs) with a reﬂectivity of ∼70\% at this wavelength. Moreover, the primary lithography tool manufacturer, ASML, has identiﬁed 6.x nm, where x∼7, as the wavelength of choice for so-called Beyond EUVL, based on the availability of La/B4C MLMs, with theoretical reﬂectance approaching 80\% at this wavelength. The optimum sources have been identiﬁed as laser produced plasmas of Gd and Tb, as n = 4–n = 4 transitions in their ions emit strongly near this wavelength. However, to date, the highest conversion efﬁciency obtained, for laser to EUV energy emitted within the 0.6\% wavelength bandwidth of the mirror is only 0.8\%, pointing to the need to identify other potential sources or consider the selection of other wavelengths. At the same time, sources for other applications are being developed. Conventional sources for soft x-ray microscopy use H-like line emission from liquid nitrogen or carbon containing liquid jets which can be focused using zone plates. Recently the possibility of using MLMs with n = 4−n = 4 emission from a highly charged Bi plasma was proposed and subsequently the possibility of using Δn = 1 transitions in 3rd row transition elements was identiﬁed. All of these studies seek to identify spectral features that coincide with the reﬂectance characteristics of available MLMs, determine the conditions under which they are optimized and establish the maximum conversion efﬁciencies obtainable. Thus, there is a need for systematic studies of laser produced plasmas of a wide range of elements as some of the challenges are similar for all of these sources and some recent results will be presented.},

Yet, instead of a fully informed and deliberative public, past research indicates that it is more likely that the public by nature is ‘miserly’, with individuals relying on their value predispositions and only the information most readily available to them from the mass media and other sources in order to formulate an opinion about science controversy. Building on this latter ‘accessibility’ or ‘memorybased’ model of opinion formation, this study tests the relationship between an increase in available information—or increasing ‘awareness’—and public support for embryonic stem cell research. An analysis of national survey data collected in the USA during the fall of  and the fall of  indicates that although an increase in awareness leads to an increase in support for research, both religious and ideological value predispositions strongly moderate the impact of awareness.},

Increasingly, however, consumers are utilizing platforms–—such as content sharing sites, blogs, social networking, and wikis–—to create, modify, share, and discuss Internet content. This represents the social media phenomenon, which can now signiﬁcantly impact a ﬁrm’s reputation, sales, and even survival. Yet, many executives eschew or ignore this form of media because they don’t understand what it is, the various forms it can take, and how to engage with it and learn. In response, we present a framework that deﬁnes social media by using seven functional building blocks: identity, conversations, sharing, presence, relationships, reputation, and groups. As different social media activities are deﬁned by the extent to which they focus on some or all of these blocks, we explain the implications that each block can have for how ﬁrms should engage with social media. To conclude, we present a number of recommendations regarding how ﬁrms should develop strategies for monitoring, understanding, and responding to different social media activities.},

	abstract = {Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is currently considered as the leading technology for high-volume manufacturing below sub-20 nm feature sizes. In parallel, EUV interference lithography based on interference transmission gratings has emerged as a powerful tool for industrial and academic research. In this paper, we demonstrate nanopatterning with sub-10 nm resolution using this technique. Highly efﬁcient and optimized molybdenum gratings result in resolved line/space patterns down to 8 nm half-pitch and show modulation down to 6 nm half-pitch. These results show the performance of optical nanopatterning in the sub-10 nm range and currently mark the record for photon-based lithography. Moreover, an efﬁcient phase mask completely suppressing the zeroth-order diffraction and providing 50 nm line/space patterns over large areas is evaluated. Such efﬁcient phase masks pave the way towards table-top EUV interference lithography systems.},

(For a binary representation, the Walsh transform is the Fourier transform.) The results are of a theoretical nature and are based on the analysis of mutation and crossover. The Fourier transform of the mixing matrix is shown to be sparse. An explicit formula is given for the spectrum of the diﬀerential of the mixing transformation. By using the Fourier representation and the fast Fourier transform, one generation of the inﬁnite population simple genetic algorithm can be computed in time O(cℓ log2 3), where c is arity of the alphabet and ℓ is the string length. This is in contrast to the time of O(c3ℓ) for the algorithm as represented in the standard basis. There are two orthogonal decompositions of population space which are invariant under mixing. The sequel to this paper will apply the basic theoretical results obtained here to inverse problems and asymptotic behavior.},

Using this method at the short wavelengths of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray provides additional advantages such as high photoresist absorption and low proximity effects. Operating at these short wavelengths, however, associates technical challenges such as light source, optics, transmission masks, and photoresists. Several research groups around the world have set up infrastructures to utilize interference lithography at this wavelength range for different applications. In this article we brieﬂy review the works of these groups in terms of their light source, instrumentation, and achievements. We present more technical in-depth description of the illumination light source arrangements at our XIL-II beamline at the Swiss Light Source and the tabletop system at RWTH Aachen. We describe high-resolution mask fabrication and implementation, as well as achievements in photoresist patterning at cutting-edge resolutions. Moreover, we describe other methods of patterning at these wavelength regimes, such as Beyond EUV lithography, making tall nanostructures, and Talbot lithography. In addition, we show some of the applications of EUV-IL in nanoscience.},

Based on that, we derive the mutual information between the mask pattern and print image, as well as the maximum information transfer (MIT) of the coherent lithography system. This paper also reveals and discusses the physical meaning of MIT in the lithography imaging process. Finally, a method to calculate the theoretical limit of image ﬁdelity using the MIT is proposed and veriﬁed by a set of simulations.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of capacity fade of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 (M = Li, Ni, Co, Mn) composite positive electrode within a full cell was investigated using a combination of operando neutron powder diffraction and transmission X-ray microscopy methods, enabling the phase, crystallographic, and morphological evolution of the material during electrochemical cycling to be understood. The electrode was shown to initially consist of 73(1) wt \% R3m LiMO2 with the remaining 27(1) wt \% C2/m Li2MnO3 likely existing as an intergrowth. Cracking in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle under operando microscopy observation was revealed to be initiated by the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase on charge to 4.55 V vs Li+/Li and intensified during further charge to 4.7 V vs Li+/Li during the concurrent two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase, involving the largest lattice change of any phase, and oxygen evolution from the Li2MnO3 phase. Notably, significant healing of the generated cracks in the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle occurred during subsequent lithiation on discharge, with this rehealing being principally associated with the solid-solution reaction of the LiMO2 phase. This work reveals that while it is the reduction of lattice size of electrode phases during charge that results in cracking of the Li2MnO3·LiMO2 electrode particle, with the extent of cracking correlated to the magnitude of the size change, crack healing is possible in the reverse solid-solution reaction occurring during discharge. Importantly, it is the phase separation during the two-phase reaction of the LiMO2 phase that prevents the complete healing of the electrode particle, leading to pulverization over extended cycling. This work points to the minimization of behavior leading to phase separation, such as twophase and oxygen evolution, as a key strategy in preventing capacity fade of the electrode.},

	abstract = {Consumers are adopting increasingly active roles in co-creating marketing content with companies and their respective brands. In turn, companies and organizations are looking to online social marketing programs and campaigns in an effort to reach consumers where they ‘live’ online. However, the challenge facing many companies is that although they recognize the need to be active in social media, they do not truly understand how to do it effectively, what performance indicators they should be measuring, and how they should measure them. Further, as companies develop social media strategies, platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are too often treated as stand-alone elements rather than part of an integrated system. This article offers a systematic way of understanding and conceptualizing online social media, as an ecosystem of related elements involving both digital and traditional media. We highlight a best-practice case study of an organization’s successful efforts to leverage social media in reaching an important audience of young consumers. Then, we conclude with several insights and lessons related to the strategic integration of social media into a ﬁrm’s marketing communications strategy.},

	abstract = {Science is the attempt to make the chaotic diversity of our sense-experience to a logically uniﬁed system of thought. A sound theoretical basis and a rational physicochemical understanding based on experimental ﬁndings lead to a proper understanding of a topic. Colloid chemistry strengthened its footing by the extensive studies on gold sols by Michael Faraday in 1850s, however, the term ‘‘colloid’’ was coined by Thomas Graham in 1861. Historically, the Stone Age paintings in the Lascaux cave in France and the written records of Egyptian pharaohs were produced with stabilized colloid pigments. The part of colloid science dealing with amphiphilic molecules is so diverse on its own that it is dealt in a separate branch called the ‘‘association colloid’’. A key development in the study of association colloids was the observation by James McBain that the osmotic pressure of salts of alkali metal fatty acid displayed a pronounced break in the concentration beyond a speciﬁc characteristic concentration, after which the osmotic coefﬁcient remained almost constant (Evans and Wennerstrom, 1994). McBain attributed this fact to the self-association of these molecules among themselves (McBain, 1913, 1944) in solution. Here, we are providing a molecular as well as thermodynamic approach toward the micellization process.},

A strength of 3D imaging is a “seeing is believing” way of reporting and analyzing data to better understand the structure/function characteristics of a sample. In addition to the excellent visualization capability, X-ray computed tomography has a lot more to offer. In this article, we review some of the experimental and analytical methods that enrich and extract scientiﬁcally relevant information from tomographic data. Several scientiﬁc cases are discussed along with how they enhance the tomographic dataset.},

Information is also “that which evolves”. When a population adapts to a local environment, information about this environment is fixed in a representative genome. However, when an environment changes, information can be lost. At the same time, information is processed by animal brains to survive in complex environments, and the capacity for information processing also evolves. Here I review applications of information theory to the evolution of proteins as well as to the evolution of information processing in simulated agents that adapt to perform a complex task.},

The SBH distributions for the mixed interfaces are about four times broader than the pure gold interface and have a complex structure arising from the incomplete intermixing and its eﬀects on the scattering of hot electrons. The maps of the barrier heights and amplitudes for the mixed samples are inhomogeneous with localization attributed to the disordered mixture of the Au and Ag. A method to calculate ratio of the Au to Ag Schottky barrier heights is presented and discussed in relationship to the interface composition. These results demonstrate how the Schottky barrier height is a function of position at the interface and how mapping can capture the electrostatic nature of these and possibly other mixed metal-semiconductor interfaces.},

This process combines ubiquitous photopatterning techniques with simple solution processing to yield highly selective and densely packed carbon nanotube patterns. The key mechanism is the change in surface chemistry caused by the UV-induced monolayer reaction. Selective deposition of carbon nanotubes was achieved by drop-casting the CNT solution onto the photopatterned substrates where the CNT solution only wets the exposed areas. Several compounds were employed, each with unique end groups that yield a range of surface energies. The selectivity is dependent on the contrast in the surface wettability. Increased selectivity was achieved by tuning the surface energy with addition of alcohol or a nonionic surfactant.},

The user-item clustering is based on the genetic algorithm (GA). The recommendation performance of the proposed methods was compared with that of traditional methods. The results showed that the GA-based visual clustering could properly cluster user-item binary images. They also demonstrated that the proposed recommendation methods were more efﬁcient than the traditional methods. The proposed VCR2 method yielded an F1 score roughly three times higher than the traditional approaches.},

The effectiveness of scientific communication is crucial to the pace of scientific progress: in all its forms it enables ideas to be formulated, results to be compared, and replications and improvements to be made. The sharing of science is a foundational aspect of the scientific method. This paper, part of the policy research within the FP7 EUROCANCERCOMS project, discusses how the Internet has changed communication by cancer researchers and how it has the potential to change it still more in the future. It will detail two broad types of communication: formal and informal, and how these are changing with the use of new web tools and technologies.},

This Chapter will help Organizations in identifying the key social media metrics for tracking and monitoring the measurement of the performance of one’s brands, products, and services in the social media channels. Once the key social media metrics are identified, organizations can choose the right tool to measure the metrics defined. This would help Organizations to improve or enhance their marketing and operational business strategies by leveraging the power and reach of the social media channels.

To this end, we have crawled the YouTube site for four months, collecting more than 3 million YouTube videos’ data. In this paper, we present a systematic and in-depth measurement study on the statistics of YouTube videos. We have found that YouTube videos have noticeably different statistics compared to traditional streaming videos, ranging from length and access pattern, to their growth trend and active life span. We investigate the social networking in YouTube videos, as this is a key driving force toward its success. In particular, we ﬁnd that the links to related videos generated by uploaders’ choices have clear small-world characteristics. This indicates that the videos have strong correlations with each other, and creates opportunities for developing novel techniques to enhance the service quality.},
